 Aye just another late night tryna write a songWhen I get a text saying "Party's back on"So I change my fit, pick my keys up off my deskMy mom ask where I'm going and I say "To see some friends"Pull up to the party, it's already poppin' offThe doors already open so I don't need to knockWalk into the action, everybody dancingCatchin' up with friends, been a while since this happenedSee a cute face, used to sit behind in mathDon't know if she know me, hopin' she don't have a manI think it was in grade 10 when she disappearedForgot like all about her, haven't seen her in some years Yeah all those days are gone nowBut memories stayed aroundAnd I don't want to be alone any longer Yeah, I see all my friends lookin' at meI can feel my beat gettin' fasterAnd I don't want to throw this all away, ayeHopin' this won't be a disasterMy buzz is helping out, hope I don't lose itIt's hard to hear her words with all the music(Turn it down bro)So I tell her follow me and take her out onto the porchAnd she whisper in my ear she wanna know me more
