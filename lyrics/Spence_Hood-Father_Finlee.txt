 To the water Father Finlee walksHardly bothered by the ten-pound lock‘Round his ankles, every step he takesHeaven’s angels tremble in his wake Never seen a wall so highWatch dogs around the clockGuards at every corner(And they don’t bother calling the coroner)Once a man gets locked insideHe’s here ‘till the reaper knocksOr so they thought, till they saw one nightThat man escape, and to this dayEvery inmate knows his name To the water Father Finlee walksHardly bothered by the ten-pound lock‘Round his ankles, every step he takesHeaven’s angels tremble in his wake Legend has it he was raised in an atticMom and dad could barely afford the same patternOf asylum after asylum, praying to PoseidonTo keep the darkness outside of him; CLASSICThey say he never muttered a wordUntil the crucifix around the neck of a corrections officerCaught his eye, he said “My oh myI think I just found my ticket out of Hell on earth.”
