Girls – all I really want is girlsAnd in the morning it's girls'Cause in the evening it's girlsI like the way that they walkAnd it's chill to hear them talkAnd I can always make them smileFrom White Castle to the NileBack in the dayThere was this girl around the wayShe liked my home-piece MCAHe said he would not give her playI asked him, "Please?" – he said, "You may."Her pants were tight and that's okIf she would dance, I would DJWe took a walk down to the bayI hope she'll say"Hey, me and you should hit the hay!"I asked her out, she said "No way!"I should've probably guessed her gaySo I broke North with no delayI heard she moved real far awayThat was two years ago this MayI seen her just the other dayJockin' Mike D. to my dismay
