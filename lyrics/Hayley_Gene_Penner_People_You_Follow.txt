Flipping through pictures of people you follow
Trying to see if there's someone who wasn't there
Last time I flipped through pictures of people you follow
Of people you...
[Verse 2]
Trying to see if a face is familiar
Some perfect woman with eyes like a fantasy
Porcelain skin lit by some other galaxy
Oh, last time I flipped through the pictures of people you follow
Of people you...
[Chorus]
And I know, I know, I
It doesn't do me any good to see them next to me
These beautiful girls I really shouldn't see as enemies
Oh, no, it's the last time I flip through the pictures of people you follow
Of people you...
[Verse 3]
Flipping through pictures of people you follow
Trying to tell if there's someone who you might be loving
In ways that you were never loving me
Oh, last time I flipped through the pictures of people you follow
Of people you...
You might also like[Chorus]
And I know, I know, I
It doesn't do me any good to see them next to me
These beautiful girls I really shouldn't see as enemies
Oh, no, it's the last time I flip through the pictures of people you follow
[Outro]
Oh, I swear it's the last time I flip through the pictures
Of people you follow
Of people you...Embed
