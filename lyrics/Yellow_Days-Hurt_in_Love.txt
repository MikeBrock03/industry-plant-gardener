As I lay in the confines of my own mindAnd the cracks I findI wonder if I wasted your time bringing you hereI watched the flood of your crystal clear tearsAs they slipped from your eyesAs I slipped from your mindOh my, to be hurt in loveWell darling, that's certain loveYeah, to be hurt in love(oh to be hurt in love yeah thats certain love)Oh darling, that's certain loveAs I lay on the outside of my own mindYeah, it's cold tonightYeah, the feeling is no goodYeah, the feels not rightSo i'll just hold on tightI hear the strangest soundsFalling down these holes in the groundI can't thinkHeld back tears, but I won't blinkAs I stand on the brinkOh, to be hurt in loveTo be hurt in loveWell darling, that's certain loveYeah to be hurt in loveOh darling, that's certain love
