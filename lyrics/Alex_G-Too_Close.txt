You know i'm not one to break promisesI don't want to hurt you but i need to breatheAt the end of it all, you're still my best friendBut there's something inside that i need to releaseWhich way is right, which way is wrongHow do i say that i need to move on?You know we're heading separate waysAnd it feels like i am just too close to love youThere's nothing i can really sayI can lie no more, i can hide no moreGot to be true to myselfAnd it feels like i am just too close to love youSo i'll be on wayYou've given me more tan i can returnYet there's also much that you deserveThere's nothing to say, nothing to doI've nothing to giveI must live without youYou know we're heading separate way'sAnd it feels like i am just too close to love youThere's nothing i can really sayI can lie no more, i can hide no moreGot to be true to myselfAnd it feels like i am just too close to love youSo i'll be on my way
