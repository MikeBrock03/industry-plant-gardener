 I think you're cute, I'll keep you in the cellarShow you to the children, kill me after dinnerYou're alrightYou look like someone I could bury in the gardenCover you in diamonds when I die And when I dieAnd when I dieAnd when I die I'll dig you upI'll tear out all your feathersCook you in the oven, burn myselfWhat is mommy cookin'?She looks like a baby You love meDo you love me?You wanna die You really wanna see us laughin' at your bodyFloating down the river, baby, you're patheticYou are God, you are God, you are GodYou are God, you are God, you are GodYou are God
