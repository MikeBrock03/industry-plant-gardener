 It's one small step for manOne giant leap for mankindI have a beautiful planet You came into my life with no warningLike a flash of lightAnd I was doing fine but as you came inI watch my future rewrite I‘m not ready, I am not preparedI was so steadyOn my feet but now I’m up in the air It’s just you and meWith the world beneath our feetWe can see for miles up hereWe can go wild up hereIt’s just me and youNow we’re taking in the viewWe can spend the rest of our daysWay up here, just me and you
