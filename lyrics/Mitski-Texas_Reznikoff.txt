 It's beautiful out todayI wish you could take me upstateTo the little place you would tell me aboutWhen you'd sense that I'd want to escape Texas is a land-locked stateIt's a little bit far awayFrom the water, from the home that I've wanted to makeIt somehow, in the city, you make it there and you make it Anywhere, anywhereBut I've been anywhere and it's not what I wantI wanna be still with youDoo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo You keep your socks on in bedKeep our hearth warm"See the trees' shadows lie in black pools in the lawns"You're the breeze in my Austin nights You're the breeze in my Austin nightsYou're the breeze in my Austin nights
