Up and downYou think you're never gonna ever get coldRound and roundAnd when you're done I'm gonna find you aloneDon't come crying back to meSilly girlI hate to tell you but I'm gonna be freeIt's a lonely worldAnd all you've gotta do is walk out and seeDon't come crying back to meBecause another lonely night is okayAnd now I know time awayBrings no remedyMallory, you'd hate this melodyStuck inside your own realityMallory, you're not enough for me
