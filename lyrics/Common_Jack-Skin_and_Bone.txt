 Well I feel you watching meUnderneath a flatbush sun,But from your grassy seatYou only see a loaded gun.Yes we are children yetBut darling girl do not forgetMy old bones groan for youAnd I am blue. So I tried to keep my witBut he ran off through the darkCause he heard there's somethingInfinite hiding down in Prospect Park.So we'll barricade the slopeAnd see what vows the breezes wroteAs we dreamed so quietly,You and me. I'm all skin and bone,Stripped of all my summer clothes,Cause you tell me that we'reProtesting with winter in JulyUntil summer devil cries for more,And she will call our name.Oh we'll never be the same.
