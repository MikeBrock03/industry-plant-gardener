 It's been a minute since I've been with some womenNot 'cause they been lacking, just I've been lacking the feelingI've been staring at the ceilingListening to the chat that they're revealingWondering if I open up or keep concealingI ain't try to be demeaning, it seemsThought you knew this, I don't really do thisMoving like a JudasTalking all that talk but ain't no time for acting foolishWhen you ask, all of the brothers saying, "True, this"I might just jump on this for free, jumpin' on them freestyleI've been well, moving brain, senileIt's sole sunsets, beautiful is one guessOne morning afternoon in that sun dressThe summer flies by every morning, I'm still yawningSame conversation, never boring("Yo, she texted you." "Swear?" "Nah, it's Tommo.""Ah, for fuck's sake!") I know that these days are feeling coldMy love could take her homeAs if we never knewI was too young for you
