 Today, I will wear my white button-downI'm tired of wanting more, I think I'm finally wornFor you have a way of promising thingsAnd I've been a forest fire, I am a forest fire And I am the fire, and I am the forestAnd I am a witness watching itI stand in a valley watching itAnd you are not there at all So today, I will wear my white button-downI can at least be neat, walk out and be seen as cleanAnd I'll go to work, and I'll go to sleepAnd I'll love the littler things I'll love some littler things
