I am done spending all my money trying to find serenityMy chest was an oil drum full of rum and it was drowning my identityI sold my guitar to buy myself some time but I don’t mindNo one knows my name and I barely got a dime but I don’t mindI am done spinning out my wheels on a muddy road at nightIt never occurred to me that I could leave and come back when the mud had finally driedI sold my guitar to buy myself some time but I don’t mindNo one knows my name and I barely got a dime but I don’t mindNo I don’t mindNo I don’t mindI am done pretending I’m not spending all my days on the runI looked inside my state of mind and found a lake glistening in the sunI sold my guitar to buy myself some time but I don’t mindNo one knows my name and I barely got a dime but I don’t mindNo I don’t mindNo I don’t mind
