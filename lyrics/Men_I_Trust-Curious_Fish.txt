 Glass too thick couldn’t see through,I’ve been waiting something newBut it felt trueMy heart is true Curious fish sought distant light;Shiny trophies caught its sightI fell to loveI’m fond of love As if limestone wore my heed,It seemed fair to trust this leadBut it felt trueMy heart is true Blushing means I know too wellFish meets light from its lone shellI fell to loveI’m fond of love
