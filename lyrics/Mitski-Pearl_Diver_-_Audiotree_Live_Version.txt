 Hmm, mhm-mhmHmm, mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm, mhm Treasure hunter, you are deadThe light of the world is fadingYou cannot see the other endYour body's lost all feelingThose creatures of your woken mindDon't fear them or their hungerForgive the sea, follow the tideWith the monsters on your shoulder Pearl diver, dive, dive deeperPearl diver, dive, dive downPearl diver, dive, dive deeperPearl diver, dive, dive down Oh, hunter, if you didn't wantThe beautiful so badlyPerhaps you would've found itIn your spirit singing softlyBut hunter, you were humanDon't forget it and go safelyAnd I, I'll live without youThough the struggle will be daily
