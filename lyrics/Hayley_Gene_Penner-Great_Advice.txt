I'd ratherLove someone elseI'd ratherRespect myselfBut it's hard toWhen everything you do makes me want youEven when you're the worst I'm always boud toWant you, when I don't want to'Cause half of the time you're all I seeAnd half of the time you're nowhere at allAnd I've said it before a thousand timesHalf the time isn't good enoughI know IGive great adviceI wish I could take my own and let you goBut it's hard toI'm crying in cars, I'm praying for some bad nеwsSo I could have some reason to havе to call youAnd say something that's not "I love you"'Cause half of the time you're all I seeAnd half of the time you're nowhere at allAnd I've said it before a thousand timesHalf the time isn't good enoughI've said it before a thousand timesI know why I'm better off
