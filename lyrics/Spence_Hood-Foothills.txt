 I come from the foothills brother but don’t be fooled‘Cause when my foot hits hill it only knows one ruleThe house lights burn brighter than the stageIt’s a fallacy we all gotta take to the graveAnd that tie looks a little like a leash to meBut the cul-de-sac curse is gonna set you free‘Lectricity’s paid, your landlord’s happyWhen the tenants aren’t complaining ‘bout the neighbor’s shitty rappingBut enough about me, you’re the head of the tableThe king in this fable, I’m the dirt in your stableI’m just an ex who never washed your sweater‘Till I decide I like my own songs betterWhat a way for a guy to go downWhen the fans recognize they can melt this crownTargaryen me, wary would be putting it lightlyThat’s the leading cause among the high and the mighty And I got bones of maple, and I got a tone worth stealingAnd ain’t nobody told us that a chorus couldn’t have a little feelingI got bottles a-plenty to pour down the drainAnd I’ll keep putting pen on paper ‘till the dragon be slain And I don’t know who to ask permissionOr when to catch my breath when I’m kissing into youAnd when the season’s through I’ll end up missing youSo while it still tastes new, let’s do like cats doAnd pretend we don’t care, pretend that life’s fairPretend the rain ain’t a logistical nightmareFor a boy trying to validate his insecuritiesWhy won’t they pray for me?If you see a light on the hill, you go follow itIf the mic’s directional you gotta swallow itYou know four score and seven life lessons agoI learned that preaching to the pavement is an all-time lowYet, here I am, scripture in handWith my sympathetic, synaesthetic view of the manAnd I say he ain’t half badOr maybe I’m the starry-eyed son he never had
