 And as the sun goes downAnd the stars come out to playI bet tomorrow I’ll be sleepingSleeping all dayAnd this fire I feelWhy is it burning so slowly?I can’t stop thinking of youLike the five pounds you owe me 'Cause you’re on my mind'Cause you’re on my mindYou’re all I can find'Cause you’re on my mind Please tell me that you feel the sameThat we're on the same trainIf you're a little bit late and miss itThat would be a great shameI miss your sweet, sweet kisses and lovin’When they were mineWhen are you down?Make sure I’m in town
