I've been down so longI forget to breathe in sometimesTo breathe in sometimesAlthough we try so hardDon't forget to breathe in sometimesTo breathe in sometimesTo breathe in sometimesTo breathe in sometimesTo breathe in I think that we've been workingTo hard its time we put it downLets go on a walk and we canExplore up another townHold on to my hands and lookDeep inside of my green eyesLets just take a breatheWe'll make it through alrightI forget to breathe inAll i do is breathe outStress up in my headHoping that I dont freak outLets take a break take a restBaby lay downPut you head on my chestFeelings break outWe can make it throughBaby hold onYou're the one I've beenWanting for so longWe can make it throughBaby hold tightFree your mind with theStars in the night sky
