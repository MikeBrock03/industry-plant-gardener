 Come on baby show meAll your smart bloodHazel’s standingOutside on his carFollowing you homeTo your apartmentYou were planningSomething without Jesus Only reason that I did itWas to find out what it’s likePass the billboard on the street and wonder if hell will swallow me up Fate is drawing back its leg to kick meYou stand outside and preach through the glass at the moviesYou filled all your shoesWith rocks and left the houseThen when you got homeYou had the things to blind yourself Only reason that I did itWas to find out what it's likePass the billboard on the street and wonder if hell will swallow me up
