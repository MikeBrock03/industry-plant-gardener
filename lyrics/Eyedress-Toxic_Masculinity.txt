 I mask up my emotionsI try to hide the pain insideI feel so cold I wanna cryBut I can't let it go'Cause that's not the man you know My self-esteem is brokenYou came to my life and made it rightI'm so grateful I wanna cryBut I won't let it show'Cause that's not the man you know Most of the time I hide my pain insideI got a lot going on inside my mindI got some people trying to block me when I shineI wanna fight but it's just a waste of timeYeah, it's just a waste of time
