 My attention she rolls between her thumbAnd her index fingerBoys, they linger at their own demiseEyes of emerald, like the hems she's been practisingOn Goodwill sweatersNow, where's her Parsons letter?She might not know that I existBut just wait till I'm a buck fiftyAnd get that old Camino fixedBailey by design is a someday sort of valentineAnd my oh my what a someday that'll beBailey takes her time with cream and sugar and the crooked linesOf that note that I know she'll never readBaby, that's fine by meCause while Bailey's stealing peeks between her stitchesI might steal one for myself Thirty seconds, that must be some kinda recordBefore some lovesick fella asks me"Honey whatcha making?"Can't you tell, I'm making plansTo dress the world with these two handsDon't need no man to 'splain it to meUnless that man's on laundry duty
