 At night on the roof top, I untie my hairAnd watch from my plastic chair as my dark hair unleashes the nightThe scent of flowers still in bloom from morning shower, and ISay your name in hopes you'll hear it in the stars And carry me outCarry me out I drive when it rains at night, when it rains, I driveAnd the headlight spirits, they lead me down the StyxSo black it shines And carry me outCarry me out At night on the roof top, I untie my hairAnd watch from my plastic chair as my dark hair unleashes the night
