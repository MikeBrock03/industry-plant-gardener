Lyin' here with you so close to meIt's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breatheCaught up in this momentCaught up in your smileI've never opened up to anyoneSo hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my armsWe don't need to rush thisLet's just take it slowJust a kiss on your lips in the moonlightJust a touch of the fire burning so brightNo I don't want to mess this thing upI don't want to push too farJust a shot in the dark that you just mightBe the one I've been waiting for my whole lifeSo baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnightI know that if we give this a little timeIt'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna findIt's never felt so real, no it's never felt so rightJust a kiss on your lips in the moonlightJust a touch of the fire burning so brightNo I don't want to mess this thing upI don't want to push too farJust a shot in the dark that you just mightBe the one I've been waiting for my whole lifeSo baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight
