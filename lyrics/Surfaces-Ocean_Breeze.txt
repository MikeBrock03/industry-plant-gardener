 Is this real, I want to beOr am I caught in a fantasyFeel you there, next to meAs I slowly fade into your ocean breeze Oh, ocean breeze, ocean breezeFade away in your ocean breezeOh, ocean breeze, ocean breezeFade away in your ocean breeze Me and you, you and meFlying off to the galaxiesHear your voice, whisperingItâ€™s so real that i can hardly breathe, in your ocean breeze Ocean breeze, ocean breezeFade away in your ocean breezeOh ocean breeze, ocean breezeFade away in your ocean breeze In the waves, mind at easeSailing through these old memoriesClose my eyes, just to seeIf i still fade away in your ocean breeze
