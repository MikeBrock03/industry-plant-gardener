[Verse 1]In Paris they say good morningIn LA they say good nightGetting lost inside this cityWishing you were here by my side[Pre Chorus]I hope you know where you're going, but you're just as lost as meAnd you walk with such conviction and I'm eyes-closed following[Chorus]And it's a black coffee morning on the east sideAnd you're smoking on the balconyTalking some shit about a good timeAnd making me happy[Post Chorus]Oh, play it again for meBig bright moon in the skyAnd give me one more night with my babyAnd that'll be alright[Verse 2]I can see from hereIt's raining on my houseAnd it's windy on the mountainTastes salty in my mouth
