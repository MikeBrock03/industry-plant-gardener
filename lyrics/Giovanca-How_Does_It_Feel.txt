You are a winner babeAnd I know my placeI showed my affection cos I thoughtWe had a promise madeBeen feeling this feelinIn the morning I'm so aloneNow you're in my place babeYou're hurt and your courage is goneNow you come to me babeHow does it feelSo in love with me babeHow does it feelYou knew you would leaveFor the opposite wayTake a piece of my heartLeave the rest on the trainThey say, time is a healerNow tell me what would you doIt wasn't make believeThe love I was feeling boyI was feeling for you
