Don't give me that loveDon't give me that loveDon't give me that loveDon't give me that loveNoI thought we were like good friendsBut I don't wanna play pretendWhispers in your eyesQuestion your intentionsAnd I don't know where you've beenIt's getting underneath my skinSomething in your smileMaking me suspiciousAnd if we're ever gonna make itI don't wanna see you fake it, just like thatOne day you don't call me backAnd if we're ever gonna make itIt doesn't mean too complicated, have my backDon't give me that superficial loveDon't give me that loveDon't give me that loveDon't give me that loveDon't give me that loveNah
