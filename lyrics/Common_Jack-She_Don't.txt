She don’t love me like no other girlNo she don’t love me like no other girlShe’s got a picture in her pocket & a pistol in her hand.She don’t stand like nobody else,No she don’t stand like nobody else.The room will light up & she and I will lay the land.I don’t know what Chicago saidNo I don’t know what Chicago saidCause I buried myself beneath the dirt and grassYes I buried myself beneath the dirt and the grass.So I will love her like no other girlYes I will love her like no other girl.Cause she don’t care what has come to passNo she don’t care, no she don’t care what’s come to pass.
