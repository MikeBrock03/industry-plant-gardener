[Verse 1]Weaklings playin’ a risky gameFools, no independence to their nameReasons I watched from the sidelinesIt’s a beautiful match, but it wasn’t mine to play[Pre-Chorus]But recently, I’ve had a change of heartAnd I regret holdin’ myself back from this part[Chorus]I wanna be easy to loveI wanna love easilyI wanna be easy to loveI wanna love easily[Verse 2]Now I’m reflectin’ on the wasted timeI apologize to those that I called mineToo late, I’m ready to surrenderMyself to exhilarating splendor[Pre-Chorus]I was mistaken, reducing love to infatuationRecently, I’ve had a change of heartAnd I regret holding myself back from this part
