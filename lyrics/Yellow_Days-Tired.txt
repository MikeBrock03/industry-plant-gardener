 Oh, what's the use of trying? All you get is grades like thatHoward, there's a very familiar pattern of behavior there. Sometimes we expect great things. Things can't always work out the way we expect. When we're severely disappointed, we become emotionally upset. Well, let me try to give you an example of this pattern of emotional upsets... You say you're tired and I understandCause you're my woman and I'm your manI'm always away with the moodAlways and is sure, of what to do I drag my feet, all the way homeFigured I should probably spend some time aloneMe, myself, and poor old IWe always got dumbfounded and we can cry Now, dreaming, together with realistic planning, can be very fruitful. But John's dream was not realistic. He expected perfection on his very first try. Naturally You say you're tired and I understandCause you're my woman and I'm your manI'll always wait with youAlways unsure of what to do They scream from the towers, sit back and relaxI listen closely, but can't repeat their actsIs that the prize of a good life, then that's what I'll saySo darling for you I'm gonna change my ways
