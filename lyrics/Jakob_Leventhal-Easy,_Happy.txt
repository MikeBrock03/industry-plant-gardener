 Hear the sun, see the birdsEverything you give will returnSo, smile when you learnThat life isn’t foreverEvery time that you laughYou receive a photographA snapshot of halfOf this human experience And everything you knowWill vanish eventuallyLike the winter’s snowIt ends with you and meSo, let's just enjoy the sunAnd our collective historyMaybe then we’ll be happy See the breeze, smell the treesEnjoy the warmth before we freezeNow that this world is diseasedThere’s only so much time left
