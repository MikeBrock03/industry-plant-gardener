Don’t be alarmed if you speak & I don’t talk back,My mind’s gone elsewhere to avoid another panic attackBecause he realized the generation that raised him are the onesResponsible for all the false adoration of theseThings that always seem to miss the mark before they start;We’re spending all our money and in return expect a fuller heart.The man who lent you twenty dollar bills is standing at your doorAsking for thirty& this time a little more.I woke up Monday morning, went to check my phone,I saw a talking head convinced I thought I was proneTo hysteria stirred by an unknown face & a lack of courage stuck to the sticking place.Maggie always told me don’t let the control be divided by those on high who always seek to troll me.The coward out of power’s always first to run away,Seems a shame to let him go until today.All we really want is a change of pace.So keep walking and don’t speak softly.I’m not deaf but I doubt I’ll hear a word you say,I’m much to busy writing hate mail to the NRA,& Paul is making calls to ask a favor for his friend,The deputy who says he knows a guy is stepping in.But the postmodern world looks like the old one,The riots at the door have turned their hate into a slogan,The postmodern rebel’s turned his cause into a label;His megaphone a muzzle, his stage into a stable.
