They remember the girl in the tracksuitThe moment she blew them awayAnd nobody saw the train wreckIf they had, would it have ended the same?Oh DoloresThey're here againRun the waterShut out the dayEveryone's fighting a battle you know nothing aboutOh DoloresSwallow the painSwallow the painYour mother came out to New York to get youSaying come back to your old little roomYou look tired of trying to hold it togetherAnd it was all too much too soonOh DoloresThey're here againRun the waterShut out the dayEveryone's fighting a battle you know nothing aboutOh DoloresSwallow the painSwallow the pain
