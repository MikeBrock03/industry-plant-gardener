 "My cheek brushes against hisSmooth on stubble for a momentAnd then it's goneHe walks along the platform as if in a dreamEvery fiber in me wants to shout and scream'Stop!'To run across to him, to take him in my armsTo tell him, 'I love you! You silly, silly man, I love you!'But instead I stand stillHeart crackingThose little curls on the back of his head bouncingAs he steps out of my life, forever." I hope that the fire we both madeStill burns a little in youI wrote to you everydayDid my letters find their way?Our memories on my screenTwo lovers in this mystic dreamBaby, come back to me, come back to meToo much time on my phoneBaby, do you still sleep alone?Come back to me, come back to me
