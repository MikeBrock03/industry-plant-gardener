 Woke from a dream in which you'd left mePosing for cars on the American stoopDon't make me beg you just 'cause you canI'm just a woman with a lonelinessI'm just a woman with needs And how could you ever conceiveHow much I need you, how truly barren I can be?They say that time, it is the only certaintyBut it's been one o'clock for hoursOh, the day is long, untangling Can't sort release from what I sold youIs this what it takes to enjoy the day?All of my pleasures left on displayI'm just a hollow root pushing throughI'm just the empty space inside the room And how could you ever conceiveThis adolescent heart skipping beats?When all your love, it grows full and firm beneathWithout a festered thought, without an emerald wantJust a single slow desire fermenting
