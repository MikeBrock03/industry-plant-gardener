 There was something 'bout her faceSomething 'bout the way that they would tasteLittle lips after slipping everything she shouldn't saySaying everything that couldn't waitSaying wouldn't it be greatA little bait heard a little lateYears of trying me, finally, im a slip her on a dateSaying wait, the day will breakTrying to play it straightBut she was saying wake me up at eightNow im talking lateJack way back when I get eczema on my elbowsBefore she found shelter in the shell-toesWe felt those, lowsThat Heaven in the hell holesWaiting for a situation saying we should quell those feelingsWe're feeling, cause I don't get no ease in the eveningRelease when I'm dreamingAnd she would say she can't believe what she's readingCause everything I write has been misleading, she needs him She needs himUh-uh, she needs himShe needs himUh-uh, she needs himShe needs himUh-uh, she needs himShe needs him
