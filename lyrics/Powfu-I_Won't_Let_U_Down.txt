 I been tryna do my bestAnd I hate it when you're still upsetIt's been harder since the day my mom leftAll these sad thoughts stuck in my headTell me if I'm doing it wrong'Cause I just wanna make you proudTell me how to be a better man'Cause I don't wanna let you down againNo, I don't wanna let you down againNo, I don't wanna let you down again Oh, I don't wanna let you down againNo, I don't wanna let you downFor the first time, I don't even know how to calm down, when I'm with you Always feel the same when they hit me upYeah there's no escape when I fuck it upWhen I'm by your side, baby that's enoughYou make me feel at home, I can't get enoughBaby, won't you stay?I'll find another wayI promise I can be thereIf you just let me try again
