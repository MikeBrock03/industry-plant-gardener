 I tried not to slipSank into a leather chair and lost my gripShut my eyes to keep my cool but started burning upI needed you to give enoughTo get me through the worst of it Oh I’m coming downThe record’s spinning slowly roundYou are telling jokes againTo bring me back from where I’ve beenI could die tonight beside you babeA beam of light beneath a spot of shade I lived a long life tonightMy busy mind was trying to catch the flecks of lightI heard you say we’re fighting wars that won’t be wonUntil the day we both are goneBut we will be alright Oh I’m coming downThe record’s spinning slowly roundYou are telling jokes againTo bring me back from where I’ve beenI could die tonight beside you babeA beam of light beneath a spot of shade
