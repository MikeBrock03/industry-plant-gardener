 I call you, to see you againSo I can win, and this can finally endSpend an hour on my makeupTo prove something Walk up in my high heelsAll high and mightyAnd you say "Hello"And I lose 'Cause nobody butters me up like you, andNobody fucks me like me In the morning, in a taxiI'm so very payin' for Why am I lonely for lonesome love?Why am I lonely for lonesome love?Why am I lonely? (Solid work)
