 Woke up early in the mornin'Just to feel the light of dayHad to open up my windowGet the shadows out my wayBanana pancakes for my problemsFind me jamming old Jack JohnsonSwear I heard them angel callsLay outside As Heaven fallsHeaven fallsHeaven fa-a-a-allsAs Heaven fallsHeaven fallsHeaven fa-a-all down on me Nothin quite like all this colorCouldn't paint a better dayGot good times on the horizonI can see them on their wayCouple birds came up beside meHad to feed em some Bob MarleySwear I heard them angel callsLay outside
