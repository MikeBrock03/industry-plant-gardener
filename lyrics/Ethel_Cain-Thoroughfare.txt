 You fell in love with America when you were twelve years oldAnd by seventeen, you knew you had to see it allYou loved your dad and the love he had for your mother, soYou had to get out and go chasin' its sweet call I met you there in Texas somewhere on the thoroughfareOn the side of the road in some torn-up clothes with a pistol in my pocketI didn't trust no one, but you said, "Baby, don't run, I'll take you anywhere"So I hopped right in, outta luck to spend, and at least your truck beats walking And you said, "Hey, do you wanna see thе west with me?'Cause lovе's out there and I can't leave it be"And I said, "Honey, love's never meant much to meBut I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need" So we made off for CaliforniaTo find your lover, drivin' day and nightAnd every small town dinerSaw our faces at least once or twiceBut in these motel roomsI started to see you differently, oh'Cause for the first time since I was a childI could see a man who wasn't angry
