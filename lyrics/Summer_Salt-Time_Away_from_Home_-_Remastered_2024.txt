I’ve been waiting patiently hereWith a porters love song, a bottle of beerA dream, my keep, alive in my sleepI’ve been treading dark deep through the nightBeyond the brave, the wild tiki lightTurning moons over, away I runWell give me some rain, wash me awayWake me up easy, I might be okayGive me some time, give me some time away from homeGive me some time to let things goI’ve been looking out over thе roamShadowed in mountain, afraid to move onIt’s hard to think I’ve been at this for daysWеll I don’t know if I’ll ever get homeBeside the fire, young foot in the stoneI feel that breeze, it’s calling my nameWell give me some rain, wash me awayWake me up easy, I might be okayGive me some time, give me some time away from homeGive me some time to let things go
