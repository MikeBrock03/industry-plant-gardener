 You had me going from the day we metMade so many memories I can't forgetAlways thinking of the times we spentBut I don't want toBut I don't want toHad me going from the day we metMade so many memories I can't forgetAlways thinking of the times we spentBut I don't want toI don't wanna think about you I don't wanna think about youI don't wanna think about youI don't wannaI don't wannaI don't wanna, no I've been feeling lostTalking with your ghostScrolling through your InstaLooking through your old postsMe and you and doggoSmiling for the cameraBoth of you are gone nowI am just the last of usI wish you never left meWish you never met meSo I didnâ€™t have to feel this painThat's never endingWhile you're up in heavenMake sure you save me roomThe good will die youngSo I hope I die soon
