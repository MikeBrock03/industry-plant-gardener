Snuck in through the tennis courtsLaid in the dark on the carpeted floorCame here for a party in middle schoolRode my bike home drunk off of a Four LokoLast time I saw you was a live stream of a funeralYou laughed when you told a story from when we were youngLooks like you're holding up alrightBut I know it's sometimes hard to tellI don't sleep in that room anymoreWhen the cicadas sync up, they breathe too hardWe watched a Phish concert and Human CentipedeTwo things I now wish I had never seenWe smoked weed out of a Pepsi canLyin' around under a Christmas tree
