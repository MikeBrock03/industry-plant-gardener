 I'm beautiful, I know 'cause it's the seasonBut what am I to do with all this beauty?Biology, I am an organism, I'm chemicalThat's all, that is all I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, tooAnd feel my skin is plump and full of life, I'm in my primeI'm liquid smooth, come touch me, tooI'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe about to fall, capture me Or at least take my picture崩れてゆく前にI'm pulsing, my blood is red and unafraid of livingBeginning to end I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, tooAnd feel my skin is plump and full of life, I'm in my primeI'm liquid smooth, come touch me, tooI'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe about to fall How I feel this river rushing through my veinsWith nowhere else to go, it circles 'round
