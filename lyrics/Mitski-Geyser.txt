 You're my number one, you're the one I wantAnd I've turned down every handThat has beckoned me to comeYou're my number one, you're the one I wantAnd I've turned down every handThat has beckoned me to come 'Cause you're the one I got, you're the one I gotSo I'll keep turning down the handsThat beckon me to come Though I'm a geyser, feel it bubbling from belowHear it call, hear it call, hear it call to me, constantlyAnd hear the harmony only when it's harming meIt's not real, it's not real, it's not real enough But I will be the one you needThe way I can't be without youI will be the one you needI just can't be without you
