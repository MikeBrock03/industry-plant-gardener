Excuse me miss madonnaWon't you look me in the eyeI've got all these funny questionsAnd I've got nowhere left to hideIt was wonderful to meet youAt that bar last year agoNow I'm pondering the million waysThat I could say helloI say hi but you're not the sameThe image trapped inside my brainWasn't who you really ever wereOh honey darlingWhere have you goneCause I've been waiting (waiting)Waiting so longEvery time that I'm with youMy world gets a little blueOh honey darling (ahhh)Dreams will doIt's funny how I felt I knew youBefore we even spokeIt's funny how I crafted youFrom images you post
