 There is a door to meI've never seen itSometimes I get closer to itBut I've never found itAt twilight, I almost had itBut then the night fellI looked out at the dark and wonderedHow could I have lost it? Then, one night, at the park I saw itWith my cheek in the dirtI couldn't move underneath the darkBut at least I finally found itCried out a creak and openedTo show me what's beyond itA hopeless violenceI named it love
