Verse 1Everything is changedIt's been rearrangedGood God, how'd it get to this stageWatch the innocence fadeAs people gain their sightAnd they can't get a word outUnless it's four lettersCause they think it's betterThey think they're invincibleThey think they canChorusI don't know why they wish to grow upForever stuck in Never LandI'm Peter PanYou can call me a lost girlCause that's what I amLost in the worldLost in my thoughtsLost cause society could eat me all upLost in the questionI'll never know the answer toLost but the joke's on you
