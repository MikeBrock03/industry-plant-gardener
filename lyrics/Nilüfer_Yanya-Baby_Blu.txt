 ColdCold, as I already know you won't be thereIf I had seen that it wasn’t a dreamWould you be here?Baby, I'm blue, don't tell me the truthTell me it’s alrightTaking it slowTry not to call, try not to careI'm taking it slowTry not to fall, try not to care Don't look backYou've had enough of all my loveI guess it's just too badWe're moving on nowAnd ain't it sad?Giving up now, giving up all our loveI guess it's just too badWe’re moving on now, somehow DeepDeep underwater, I breathe, let me soakChasing the shades of the love that we madeOf the love that we brokeBaby was blueBut I think that we knew it was gonna be alrightNow that you’re near, I feel you still hereOh, what a shame
