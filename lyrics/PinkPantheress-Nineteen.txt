 Some days when I'm down just a little bit, I drop myself to the floorIt's not a problem if it hurts because I can't feel ache anymoreI only came back home because I wanted to see what's changedAnd when I realise everyone's gone, but I still feel the same I wasn't meant to beThis bored at nineteenMy friend lived next to meNow she won't wanna seeMe look differentlyNow that I'm nineteen And I wish that I could tell all my ex-jobs in retailThat I should've stayed at work 'cause of the A-Levels I failedMy cousin just told me that my favourite shop shut downAnd the other one just told me that I've always got a frown My, my mind's alone because I'm aloneMy mind's alone because I'm alone(Enough the lot, I've had enough)My mind's alone because I'm alone (The gore, the pain)(I've had so much, I love to hate)My mind's alone because I'm alone (The way I shaped because I'm hurt)(And living rough)
