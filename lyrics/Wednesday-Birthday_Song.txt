 We were sitting aroundWaiting for one of us to come downWe were in high schoolWe'd just dropped acid in someone's living roomDidn't know where to lookHe jumped out of the window and broke his foot He tried to fix it himselfBut it wouldn't work that way this timeWe tried to get rid of the stuffSo that one of us could get up to drive I thought it really set the toneCouldn't laugh at it yetWasn't far away from it yet
