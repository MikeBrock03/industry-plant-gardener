 So don't look so surprisedWhen I know where you've beenWhat's that look in your eyes?Gonna spend all your winsUntil they're vaporisedOh, and all the lossSome men they call the showThen I wonder what you cost Again, again, again, againDo you like pain?Again, again, again, againAgain, oh, againDo you like pain? Baby luv, I triedBut I cannot forgiveI'm crazy all insideSo I'm leaving you with himSun bleached and dusty whiteNo one sees it's, so unfairYou're still beautifulI could watch you comb your hair
