 Protecting you, protecting meI throw the evidence into a trunk and drop it in the seaLie awake, I sleep awakeI sleep with one eye on the bedroom door, the other on the cakeProtecting me, protecting youCarving away our fingerprints out of our fingertips until they're smooth Lie awake, I sleep awakeI sleep with one eye on my royal flush, the other on the takeI sleep awake Protecting this, protecting thatCalling a deadbeat with his dead bolt wrapped around his artifactProtecting thatLie awake, I sleep awakeI sleep with one hand on my .45, the other 'round my baby's waist Lie awake, I sleep awakeI go to bed with all my lights turned on so I don't slip awayI stay awakeOut on the street I keep a started car who only waits for meConveniently
