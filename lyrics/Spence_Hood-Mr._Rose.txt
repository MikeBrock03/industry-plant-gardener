There's a man on the hillAnd his pockets are filled up with rosesThough I don't see him oftenAnd I don't think he knowsThe problem that this posesFor if I had to live without himI'd want nothing more to do with this mountainMister Rose, I don't supposeYou'd want to spend your afternoon with me?We can walk through the gardenBegging the pardon of the bluebirdsYou'll lay down on the lawnAnd I'll study your yawnI wish I'd met you soonerFor Mother and Father just paid off the dowryBut one look at you and my heart goes all floweryMister Rose, I don't supposeYou'd want to break a rule or two tonight?For my days hеre are numberеdIf I end up under the thumb of a loveless manWho wants to lock all the doorsI swear I'll run straight into the forestThe surest I've ever felt of myselfIs when you're on my mind
