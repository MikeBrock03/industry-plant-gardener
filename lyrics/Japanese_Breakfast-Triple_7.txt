 Don't you know I've always been this way?I look to you through the work weekAnd I love a man in uniform'Cause he loves me like a slot machineFrom the valley of loose women in the cruel light of morning Call out my name like something from the bottom of a wellOh, how I want, how I needHow I cling to your sleeves 'til they're like lacerated sailsBut in the night, I am someone else Don't you know it's always been the same?A pure woman is hard to find, to come by these daysAnd I know the looks of urge and scornAnd I know the role I'm meant to playThe role of the other woman who will spend her life longing Call out my name like something from the bottom of a wellOh, how I want, how I needHow I cling to your sleeves 'til they're all fucked beyond repairBut in the night, I am someone elseYes, in the night, I am someone elseOh, in the night, I am someone else
