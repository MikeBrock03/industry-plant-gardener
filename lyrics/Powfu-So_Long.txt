 The first night that I took you outMet you at the mailbox, right outside your houseTrynna stay dry under a black and white umbrellaI was in a t-shirtYou were in my sweaterYou said let's get a drinkSo we got caffeineCoffee in a cup keptBreathing out steamSitting by the windowTalking bout dreamsWhile watching outsidePeople stepping over streamsEverything I searched forSeemed you had it allBlown away by loveAnd the height of it's wallsFeeling like a superheroWe could fly awayShoot through the starsTill we find the light of dayI never even thought this couldâ€™ve been an optionBut once I felt it, I didn't wanna stopI was so in loveYou were driving me insaneMy heart would dropWhen you said my name
