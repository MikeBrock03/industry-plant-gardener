[Verse 1]Looking at a pretty viewAnd thinkin' 'bout how I love youI love youI'd like to stitch the sun to that section of the skyFor a little while[Pre-Chorus]Sometimes I get scaredI overprepareFor an outcome that I don't wantSo moments like thesePut me at easeAnd remind me of all that we've got[Chorus]Hey, listen to me nowAnd let me hold youLet me hold you nowIf I start to cryDon't ask me whyJust let me hold you now[Verse 2]Other days the clouds roll inAnd that is when the doubt beginsOoh, winsMake me walk the extra mileAnd carry you a little higherTo feel desire
