 In the dark, we were making up poemsYou like your phrases fullStrip it down, let me guess where it's goingSo I can swallow your lines whole As I dissect the phrasesI wonder if my thoughts will phase youI'll bite my tongue, but I've just got to know Are these words about me, baby?Are you thinking of me lately?When you close your eyes, do you see mine?Am I reading in too deeplyWhen you croon your words so sweetly?Oh, music makes a dreamer of me In the dark, leavе me laying in your poemsSo I can wander whеre you hideYou got nerves? Well you hardly even show 'emWhat is going on inside? As I dissect the phrasesI wonder if my thoughts will phase youI'll bite my tongue, but I've just got to know
