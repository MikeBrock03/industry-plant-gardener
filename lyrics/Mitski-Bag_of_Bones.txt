 I'm all used up, pretty boyOver and over again, my nail colors are wearing offSee my hands, pretty boyWhat do they tell you?'Cause I've looked down at them, not knowing whyAnd after everything's done and I'm all undoneYou can hear my high heels walking onClickety-clacking through the nightI'm carrying my bag of bones Fluorescent store lights, you shine through the nightIlluminate my pores and you tear me apartMercy on me, would you please spare me tonight?I'm tired of this searching, would you let me let go? I know my room is a messOver and over again I tell myself I'll clean tomorrowJust move the stuff up off the bedAnd do what you came here to doBut first, open up a window for meAnd let the cool air in, feel the night slip inAs it softly glides along your backAnd I hope you leave right before the sun comes upSo I can watch it alone
