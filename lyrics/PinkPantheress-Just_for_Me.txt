 I found the street of the house in which you stayAnd my diary's full of your name on every page'Cause I read somewhere you'll fall in love with meI'll try and try again, one day you'll seeYour hair's under my pillow, so I sleep (So I sleep)And I'm dreaming of you leaving roses at my feet (At my feet) I'm obsessed with you in a way I can't believeWhen you wipe your tears, do you wipe them just for me? (Me, me, me, me)Do you wipe them just for me? (Me, me, me, me)I'm pleading on my knees (Knees, knees, knees, knees)It's your touch that I need (Need, need, need, need) I followed you today, I was in my carI wanted to come and see you from afarIf you turned around and saw me, I would dieI'd pretend I was a person driving byWrote you a song, do you wanna hear it now? (Hear it now)Don't bring your friends along to form a crowd (Crowd)'Cause I need to prove I wrote it just for you (Just for you)What's the need for them when it could be just us two? (Two, two, two, two) I'm obsessed with you in a way I can't believeWhen you wipe your tears, do you wipe them just for me? (Me, me, me, me)Do you wipe them just for me? (Me, me, me, me)I'm pleading on my knees (Knees, knees, knees, knees)It's your touch that I need (Need, need, need, need)
