 Always wanted to believeIn some destiny to guide meFound no answers in my dreamsNo constellations that could show me Up until you floated down on a cloudI didn’t know, I didn’t knowIn your pure perfection, I’ll never doubtNow I know, now I knowLet’s lay here just a little longer Won’t you be my prophecy?You’re the only one I needWhen you’re lying next to meI don’t need no make believeWon’t you be my prophecy?You’re the only one I needWhen you’re lying next to meYou’re so real and I believe Bury me in white sheetsNeighbor’s music drifts through concreteWith your arms around meI don’t ever want to be free
