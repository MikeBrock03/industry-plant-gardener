 Sometimes you make me wanna put my fucking head through the wallSometimes I wonder if I even know you at allFall asleep to the sound of your old rotating fanI cut the fuck out of myself and soaked the bed sheets with blood again I hold my head underwater just to drown out the noiseIt's always my fault, girls will be bitches and boys will be boysI know I don’t need you, but I'm terrified of letting you goEven after all the times you fucked the shit out of me while I was crying, "No" And how am I supposed to feel good about myself when everything I do is wrong?When I'm just an ugly bitch, a fucking freak, and I don't wanna go on?And I don't wanna leave my house, 'cause I know everybody’s staring at me now"Why the hell am I alive?" is what they think, they wanna take me down And I can't get out, can’t run away, there's no escaping you now(There's no escaping you now)I'm gonna die all alone next to you in this piece of shit townAnd we've been cursed since the start, Jesus didn’t want us, noAnd you take all of your sins out on my body like everyone else doesShooting up our old school when we get bored of shooting upAnd fuck the cops, and fuck God, and fuck this town for ruining usAnd they'll put holes in all we own and in our heads, pumped full of leadYou always told me I could only leave you once we're both dead
