 This city has the same nameBut it's different than the one I leftThe sights and sounds have changed somehowAnd I'm struggling to catch my breathMaybe I'm growing olderMaybe I haven't grown at allBut I measured myself on the train tracksAnd I found I was two feet tallThe subway profits who laid in their coffinsThey begged me not to nagSo I covered all their faces upWith an old faded flag I saw Sammy on a tightropeReciting some old RimbaudTrying to feel if his heart was realInstead of a frozen stoneThe people who wandered past himWondered why Sam was so possessedTil Dave drove by, said "I know whyThere's an anvil on his chest"The good old boys with their rifle toysShouted "Sam you're a sad-eyed f*g"As they went home to keep a-dreaming onTheir old faded flag
