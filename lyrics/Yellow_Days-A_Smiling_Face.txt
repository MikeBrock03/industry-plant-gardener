 A smiling faceTold me to embrace what's comingIs it something good or bad?It's not as simple as that I owe myselfOver the cards that I dealtAs a hundred miles an hourStruggle to feel the power To say no! But darling I hopeThat it will go, It will go my way'Cause all I know and all I tried to do is make it worth itBut as I know, the feelings growAnd all I can do is lull myself deep into you A smiling faceTold me to embrace what's comingIs it something good or bad?He said, "it's not quite simple as that" If the Lord saw me now, would he be so proud?My sinner and doubtPut right over my own lifeI tried so hardEvery single day I wake up, open my eyes, the world ain't so niceIf I say it's alright, is it alright?
