 Filling empty spacesFeeling safe now we're apartSympathetic faces catch my eyeThen swiftly pass me byI am finding myselfEasy now, I'm alonePicking up the piecesOr what's right or wrong So just run and runAnd run and runAnd hideSo just run and runAnd run and runAnd hide Picture frames and mirrorsTake them down, reveal these wallsThey were built between usJust to fall awayNow the silence in my headEchoes louder than beforeSaying you were mineAnd I said I was yours
