Put your ear to the groundIt’s the most magnificent soundWhen the midnight train comes rumbling through this townFeel the wind rip through your clothesWhere it’s headed nobody knowsBut my bags are packedAnd by God I’m ready to goDon’t be concerned if I return as somebody newPeople change, it’s all the rageAnd I’ve got nothing to losePut your ear to the groundIt’s the most magnificent soundTo this Earth, my friend, we’re no longer bound
