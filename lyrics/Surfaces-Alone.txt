 Summer night and the weather’s getting colderJust a kid still afraid of getting olderSpend my time staring at the waves crashAnd you’re not here wish I never had to say that Alone, still aloneAlone, and I wanna go homeAlone, still aloneAlone, and I wanna go home When did we get in such a hurryWe moved to fast and the vision got blurrySpend my time staring at the planes passAnd you’re not here wish I never had to say that Alone, still aloneAlone, and I wanna go homeAlone, still aloneAlone, and I wanna go home
