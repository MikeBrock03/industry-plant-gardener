Nothing hurts like you do, like the way you say I love youLeave the room half undressed, I'm saying prayers through a throttled neckCome into the room and make me cry all over againYou come in so hard, gore me through the heartJust another day and you'll still tell me you're healingSee it on your face, you won't ever change in your waysShed your knuckle velvet, torn on my teethWhen you're torn apart, you'll destroy me againBleeding out on your sleeve, you kill me any way but softlyWith all your crying like you did that first night I made you spend on your ownYou're such a child and you know itNothing in my heart is hoping you'll come backToo cold to know what I don't have without you, noWithout youEvery drop of blood is love I don't get backBated to take the love that I gave away to save you
