 Flying overhead, you take controlYou're dreaming in silver and goldAnd in my head, the turbulence growsI'm fighting it, I'm taking it slowI'm breathing, I'm feeding my soulAnd overhead, our distance, it grows, I watch you go Oh no, you're living in the fast laneHold on, your life's taking off but your heart breaks (Heart breaks)I know you'll catch your airplane (Airplane)Again and againOh no, you're bending over backwardsHold on, your life's taking off but your heart breaks (Heart breaks)I know you'll catch your airplane (Airplane)Again and again Your frantic life, it gets meIt gets in under my skinLike a cannonball, I'm fighting the flowI've learned to follow in your stridesA little longer and I'll fit, I'll fit better in your linesAnd when I fill 'em in, I'll feel it overflow
