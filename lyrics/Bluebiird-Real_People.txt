It's been on my mind for some timeTaking up spaces like a hurricaneYou're telling me that you're fineCan't believe itI've been on my backAnd out of my brainGrass is always greenerWhen I don't even need herYou take it slowSo I can tell that you mean itThey're walking ????Talk about something to fill the voidTake me to the best view of the citySo I can fall off the buildingI've been watching it burnI've been smoking the flameYou've been showing up soberIf it's all, is it over ?I've been reading you throughI'vе been listening closeYou've been smiling for picturеsReflecting in the mirrorWhere all the real peopleGo ?
