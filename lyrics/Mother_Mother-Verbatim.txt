 Uh-oh, ye-ah, uh-oh, ye-ah-ohUh-oh, ye-ah, uh-oh I wear women's underwearAnd then I go to strike a pose in my full-length mirrorI cross my legs just like a queerBut my libido is strong when a lady is near, yeahWhat defines a straight man's straight?Is it the boxer in the brief or a twelve-ounce steak?Nah, I'll tell you what a woman loves mostIt's a man you can slap but can also stroke Going in the wind is an eddy of the truth and it's nakedIt's verbatim and it's shakin'No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, noNo more getting elatedNo more listless invitations UGH! I live by a hospitalAnd every day, I go out walking past its sickly windowsI see people dying thereBut my tender age makes it hard to careThe incinerator and a big smokestackIt's a phallic symbol and it makes me laugh (Ha)All I need is a heart attack, c'monHumble my bones with a cardiac (Humble my bones with a cardiac)
