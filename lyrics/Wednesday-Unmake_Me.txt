 I’m turning white in your white sheetsI sweat my forehead cleanI set my cheek on your cold floorI open holed up drawers Steady myself on the doorSteady myself on the door Reflective candy wrappers on the streetI turn the blinds ajarI show you my New York teeBut in here if someone sees meI’m here in someone’s house
