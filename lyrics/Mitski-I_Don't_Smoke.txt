 I don't smoke, except for when I'm missing youTo remember your mouth, how it tasted trueAnd I don't smoke, except for after I've held you, babyBeing with you makes the flame burn good So if you need to be mean, be mean to meI can take it and put it inside of meIf your hands need to break more than trinkets in your roomYou can lean on my arm as you break my heart I'm what's left of when we swam under the moonNow the rest of my days are just waiting for whenYou've calmed down and tell me, "I was meant for you"Baby, being with you makes the flame burn good If you need to be mean, be mean to meI can take it and put it inside of meIf your hands need to break more than trinkets in your roomYou can lean on my arm as you break my heart Just don't leave me alone wondering where you areI am stronger than you give me credit for
