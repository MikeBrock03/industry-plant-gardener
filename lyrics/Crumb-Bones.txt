 Baby, I want you to know that you're reallyDriving me crazyAnd now-ow a thousand tears a-are pouringDown to my toes Baby, you're just in my head and my daydreamsNobody knows you, it can't beCause when I think of you I swear, babeI can feel your bones Lately, you are the first one to find meDrowning and drowning, I can't swimYour waves are too big and I amFalling asleep
