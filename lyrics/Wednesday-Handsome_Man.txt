 Whistlin' past a graveyard smashWith broken glass from a car crashYou’re small and lookin' through stained glassPull over on the overpass I’m all alone in a snow globeWhere do we go when the glow goes home?I’m washing away all my love and wantA neighborhood kid with a fucked-up buzzcut Holdin' a crossbow in a family photoSending the biggest smile from TokyoWhere the wallpaper winces while you pissAnd there's a place where the kids go to kiss The only reason I’m coming homeIs for my secondhand handsome man
