 "We can do all kinds of physical things, trying to find that peace that the world is seeking. But it will still be elusive, because everything that is physical is transitory. And the only thing that is not transitory in man is his own soul." I try to see between the linesI try not to keep the spirit confinedLet it feel sunshineIt turns out the sun's gone and I don't know what is going on here I've, I've been trapped in my, my own mindNo escape I can findNo I can't let go(Yeah, ooh) I... I've been thinking too hardI was lost from the startThat's a great to-be moodI... I've been thinking too hardIt's a dangerous part that I've been to, yeah I, I don't know what's right anymoreThe sea flooded and the rain pouredI'm conditioned to surviveJust I need to be aliveI've got intuition on my sideJust to ease that paranoid mindI've cried tears ocean-wideJust to ease that pain inside (ohh, yeah)
