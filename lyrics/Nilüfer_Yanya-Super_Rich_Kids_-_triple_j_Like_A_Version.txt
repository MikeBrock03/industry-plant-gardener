 Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounceToo many bowls of that green, no Lucky CharmsThe maids come around too muchThe parents ain't around enoughToo many joy rides in daddy's JaguarToo many white lies and white linesSuper rich kids with nothing but loose endsSuper rich kids with nothing but fake friends Start my day up on the roofThere's nothing like this type of viewPoint the clicker at the tubeI prefer expensive newsNew car, new girlNew ice, new glassNew watch, good timеs, yeahIt's good timesShe wash my back three timеs a dayThis showerhead feels so amazingWe'll both be high, the help don't careThey just walk by, they must don't careA million one, a million twoA hundred more will never do
