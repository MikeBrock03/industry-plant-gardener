(Verse 1)I'm not satisfied, I'm losing precious time and II think about the hourglass, sinkin' like my alibiWill you stop a sec, give me a chance to catch my breathI haven't run like this in years, the sweat is dripping down my neck(Chorus)What's it like servin' tables on the moon?Do you get lonely as you find something to do?You're the space cadette I'm looking forThe only one I'll ever knowJust wait for me 'cause I'll be coming soon(Verse 2)I can't operate, what if therе's another way?And I've been workin' twice as hard, but latеly I stay up too lateWill you stop a sec, give me a chance to catch my breathMy heart is beatin' like a drum, the sweat is drippin' down my neck(Chorus)What's it like servin' tables on the moon?Do you get lonely as you find something to do?You're the space cadette I'm looking forThe only one I'll ever knowJust wait for me 'cause I'll be coming soon
