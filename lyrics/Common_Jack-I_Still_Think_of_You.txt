Verse:I come home again at the end of a lonesome dayAnd when I listen close all the voices seem to sayThat I still think of you while I watch the clock go round and round.Cause I saw the news yesterday,what a rodeo,A grown up man thought it was another little boy's turn to goAnd I am wondering if I’d better leave to broken town.Refrain:Cause it feels like it's burning down.Verse:I found you wanderin' all by yourselfYou grabbed me, shook me hard, and said “hey man what the hell,I really needed you when my heart was heavy as a stone.Refrain:& I saw them on a paper throneYes I saw them on a paper throne.Verse:And I’ve had my luck, yeah I've had my way,But lately all I've really had is an empty word to sayOh, I still think of you even after all this passing time.So if you're wanderin' down by my door,I hope you wander in to laugh with me before we both are westward boundTo a shelter from this storm at last.
