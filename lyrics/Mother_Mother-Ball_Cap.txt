 I like the treetops'Cause they're reaching just like meAnd I'm tied up in knotsLike the brambles and the weedsI am the rooster in the morningYou can hear me cock-a-doodlingYeah I like the peopleStanding on the street'Cause they are dumb-facedDumb-faced just like meThey're asking, "What we supposed to do?We got our left foot in our right shoe"Oh, what to do, yeah And I wear my ball cap to hide my big eyesAnd you wear your black dress to hide your big thighsOh, baby, baby, I'll lose my ball capWell, only if you expose your loose fat Oh, don't you know that beauty is only skin deep?Well, baby, baby, come on and skin meI like the bigginsOnly 'cause they make me look real thinYeah
