Big flag billow over the trailer parkWhere I buried my heartWe do the best with what we've gotMy voice is a little horseGalloping wild through the woodsLittle I learn is so expensiveIt almost kills me and purges nothingHis gun is always drawnAnd his turned back under the whiskey bottleIf its not the worst thing it'll do'til the worst thing comes along
