 All of this turbulence wasn't forecastedApologies from the intercomAnd I am relieved that I'd left my room tidyThey'll think of me kindly when they come for my things They'll never know how I'd stared at the dark in that roomWith no thoughts like a blood-sniffing sharkAnd while my dreams made music in the nightCarefully, I was going to live You wouldn't leave 'til we loved in the morningYou'd learned from movies how love ought to beAnd you'd say you love me and look in my eyesBut I know through mine, you were looking in yours And did you know the Liberty Bell is a replicaSilently housed in its original wallsAnd while its dreams played music in the nightQuietly, it was told to believe I always wanted to die clean and prettyBut I'd be too busy on working daysSo I am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecastedI couldn't have changed anyways
