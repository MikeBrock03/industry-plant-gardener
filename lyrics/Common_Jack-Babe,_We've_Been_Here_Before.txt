Verse:On the sidewalk I saw brother beg for water,So I crossed and walked along the other side& as I tried to think of places I was going,He sat there all alone inside my mind.Chorus:Hold my breath againTread among amens.Floating to the sideOf the great divide.Drag me back to the shore,Babe, we’ve been here before.Verse:In the city there is something more forgotten,Downtown her mind was lost and overthrown.We tried hard to find our way back to each otherBut through the silver glow our brother said “Child go home.”Chorus:& I fell through my phoneJust to find myself aloneWithout the sweeter soundsOf the singing towns.Cut the line, burn every cord,Babe, we’ve been here before.
