Where are we going?On a trip to Sunday-landA lazy beginningBut a complicated endI'm wondering somedayWill you understand?That I’m your companionAnd you're my only friendCuz I will follow youWherever you need me toMe to, me toI'll ask you a questionWill you drive this car for me?I’ll ask you to go wherever you desire to beTake me to your favorite rooftop showMe off the edgeI'm a little bit beside myselfCuz Sunday will never endAnd you'll always be my friendThe wheels keep on turnin'Without a sign or a clumsy warningAnd when the clock strikes twelveIt just goes back to Sunday morning
