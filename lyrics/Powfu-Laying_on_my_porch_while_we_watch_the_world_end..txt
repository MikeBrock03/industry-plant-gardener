 I can feel the world get fartherEvery year the stars get darkerRunning out of time, we don't got much leftWe can fall in love with our final breath(On and on, stay with me)I can feel the world move slower(Watch the sky patiently)I can see the trees grow older(On and on, stay with me)If you stay with me you can have my warmth(Watch the sky patiently)Watch it all end laying on my porchWatch it all end, just hold on tight (tight)Wake up in my arms on the other side (side) (Be alright)Yeah, think of me when you close your eyes Close your eyesI know nothingSomething about you Feeling like ice, when you touch me I can't move (can't move)You're the reason why I smile while I'm falling to my doomWhen you touch me I can't move (can't move)You're the reason why I smile while I'm falling to my doomWatching meteorsBut I feel secureClouds are pouring rainBut the world's in flamesBuildings falling downChaos all aroundBut with you I'm safeYou're my getaway
