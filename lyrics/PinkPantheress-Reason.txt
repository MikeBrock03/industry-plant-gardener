 I wrote this letter to remind myself the reasons I'm aliveI got to reason number fiveWith my pen, I wrote on and I triedTo find words that described all the timesI caught myself and realised there are good things just ahead of meBut right now, it gets hard to believeBut I know that I'm safe when I leave When you can't speak to meAnd when I can't receiveThe words I know you mеanYou think can set me free I know it's broken, but a littlе part of me thinks that I'm gladI can go through things that make me sadIt's the only time off that I've hadAny more, then I start to go madReason that I had at number one (Was I like to)Know the feeling well of being loved (Then number two)I like the feeling of becoming numb (I can't choose)Which one I prefer because you can't Speak to meAnd when I can't receiveThe words I know you meanYou think can set me free (It's better you leave me be)
