 My life started to change when I got olderI don't feel the same when I'm soberYou were in my lightWasted all my timeWhen I think about you I feel paralyzed Your eyes reflecting the times that we went troughSwiping through photos of when I was with youInnocenceI wonder if you miss meMemoriesThe first time tou kissed meYour eyes reflecting the times that we went troughSwiping through photos of when I was with youInnocenceThe first time that we felt loveWish I why everything got messed up Everything got messed upPictures of memories that I, will never let goAnd I figured that I'd try to get you back in, back in my lifeI, went to your school, and you never came backThought you'd drive then you left me fastSaid you lied for me, didn't wanna make me saidNow it's don't call me, don't call me again
