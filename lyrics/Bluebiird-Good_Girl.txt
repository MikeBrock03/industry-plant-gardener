 Can't spend another night aloneSo I been out but I ain't been badYou're the one I wanna come home toBut you're packed up, picked up, peaced out, manHere's a little ditty just to keep you warmAnd when it gets cold, drink your whiskey cokeCould be a play keeping you satisfiedBut I am another bruise you have to hide I'll be a good girl, I'll be your everythingJust give me one more try, just one more nightGive me one more try, just one more night (Ooh)To change your mind Your sensibility's all wrongYou take, take, take and then you get goneCould follow your tracks to the oceanBig body water of emotion But I'll be a good girl, I'll be your everythingJust give me one more try, just one more nightGive me one more try, just one more night (Ooh)To change your mind
