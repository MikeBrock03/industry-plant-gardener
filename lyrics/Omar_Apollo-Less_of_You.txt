 Is this the last time I see you?Is this goodbye?The hotel room is somewhere I please youNow you won't bat me an eye I wish it didn't have to be trueWas last night the end of me and you?I wish it didn't have to be trueWas last night the end of me and you? Oh-ooh, that's not fairI can't let you goOh-ooh, I see you everywhereI'm seein' less of youI'm still undressing youAm I depressing you?Felt like a blessin', you I still got a lot to sayDon't wanna end the night this wayI still got a lot to sayDon't wanna end the night this way
