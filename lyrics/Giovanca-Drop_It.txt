Here we are againIt's like groundhog day againThe most simple words we sayCome out wrong anywayAnd these loving arms of mineDon't know how to mendWhat we're about to breakSometimes I thinkLoving you seems more like fateThan it is a choiceLoving you is more than fateWe need to rejoiceNow wait a minute just drop itDrop the gun, drop the gun 2xHere we are againAll the reason's gone againHow it's easier too hurtSomeone you know so very wellAnd your loving arms can't findA way to mendWhat we're about to breakSometimes I thinkLoving you seems more like fateThan it is a choiceLoving you is more than fateWe need to rejoice
