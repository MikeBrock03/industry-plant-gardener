Verse:He wears a coat that doesn't shield him from the rain.Sheâ€™s hanging by a thread & calling out his nameEvery time he holds her, he can feel her pain.He tries to say what's really weighing on his mind,She guesses silent contradictions are entwined,So he looks at his boots & thinks he should get them shined.Chorus:Oh babe, he loves youIf only you knewHe is trying to tell youHe only needs a little time.Verse:She swiped her thumb and sits so numbly on the floor,He says the words but she has heard them all before,So they sit in silence & they stare at the door.Chorus:Oh babe, he loves youIf only you knewHe is trying to tell youHe only needs a little time.
