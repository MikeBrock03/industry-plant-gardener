 I don't love anyone but myself and Marty'Cause he holds my moneyI wanna be anything on TV, I wanna be famousDo you think they want me? I'll clean up while you're at workMatching socks and ironed shirtsSarah shows me how you want it I took my favorite pill on Monday, it made me go backwardsDo you wanna feel good?I made a special drink for myself and I'm gonna drink itAll by myself
