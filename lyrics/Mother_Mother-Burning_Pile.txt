 All my style, all my graceAll I tried to save my faceAll my guts, try to spillAll my holes, try to fillAll my money been a long time spentOn my drugs, on my rentOn my saving philosophyIt goes one in the bank and the rest for me It goes, all my troubles on a burning pileAll lit up and I start to smileIf I catch fire then I'll change my aimThrow my troubles at the pearly gates Ohh...Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh oh(Oh oh oh) My momma, lonely maidGot her buns in the oven, and she never got laidMy papa, renaissance manSailed away and he never came back again
