 Promised you'd keep all your promises you made to meA common mistake to break, you're gone and I was naïveThough I believed it's your fault, well, I never liedExcept when I lay in your laundry with tears in my eyes Loved me for a weekday, left me on a weekendDon't know why I pretendIt's something newWhen it hurts, it's always youTied me to a boulder, threw me in the deep endI'm turning blueWhen it hurts, it's always youI get this feeling, déjà vu Said you wouldn't be like others, well, you're just the sameA different face, different colorsCalled by different namesI thought we could swim, but you never taught me to floatBut I've been here beforeDrowning once more Loved me for a weekday, left me on a weekendDon't know why I pretendIt's something newWhen it hurts, it's always you
