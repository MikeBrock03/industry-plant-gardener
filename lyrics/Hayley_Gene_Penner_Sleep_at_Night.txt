Or you can let me show you 'round the wreckage
Some of this is harder to admit to talk about but I am trying
Giving in is harder to resist
Feeling like a boat without an anchor
Stolen silent kisses feel like quiet promises that I'll be fine
And I'm trying to pull away from this bed
But it hasn't happened yet
And I lie when I say I'll never go back
'Cause it hasn't worked like that
So hate me if you want to
You can blame me if it helps you
Breaking up your family while a siren wakes the baby, it's alright
Whatever helps you sleep at night
Whatever helps you sleep at night
And I'm not sure how you are taking this
Playing with a tiny piece of paper
Scared to see my lying eyes are the only eyes not telling lies now
And I've got my reasons for the mess
But none of them will save you from your madness
'Cause he was in my body while his words were in your hands
Somewhere across the ocean trusting him

But it hasn't happened yet
And I lie when I say I'll never go back
'Cause it hasn't worked like that
So hate me if you want to
You can blame me if it helps you
Breaking up your family while a siren wakes the baby, it's alright
Whatever helps you sleep at night
Whatever helps you sleep at night
And I'm trying to pull away from this bed
But it hasn't happened yet
And I lie when I say I'll never go back
'Cause it hasn't worked like that
So hate me if you want to

Breaking up your family while a siren wakes the baby, it's alright
Whatever helps you sleep at night
Whatever helps you sleep at nightEmbed
