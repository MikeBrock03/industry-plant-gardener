What I say every fightCould be gone tomorrowThat don't make it rightI wanna be with you all the timeEven when I push you awayWe can make it rightSomething stops me every timeWhen you're here, I am fineBut the moment you are goneOut of sight, out of mindMemory you see your notWho you were beforeAll the things we try to hideThey'll be gone tonightSomething stops me every timeWhen you're here, I am fineBut the moment you are goneOut of sight out of mindWhat I say every fightCould be gone tomorrowThat don't make it rightI wanna be with you all the timeEven when I push you awayWe can make it rightSomething stops me every timeWhen you're here I am fineBut the moment you are goneOut of sight out of mindOut of sight out of mindOut of sight out of mind
