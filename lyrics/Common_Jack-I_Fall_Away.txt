[Verse]As I lay in bed again,Searching the shadows of a stolen line,You’re gone once more to roam,Carving a message on the concrete skies.Swallow your doubt, come back to me,East of the lantern lies a lonely messWe’ll go there anywayTo sing the praises of our loneliness.[Chorus]We’re standing with each otherEye to eye, thigh to thigh,And no one sees the set of keysOn the windowsill,We stand so still,I’ve had my fill of you now.Love, it seems you’ve comeToo late tonight, I turned off the lightAnd gone to bed to rest my head,There’s nothing to say,You cannot stay,I fall away from you now.I fall away
