 There goes my lifeOn the open roadCan I be alone?I can understand youThere goes my lightHow can you be sure?I'll be going homeWith everyone beside you I can understand youI can understand youI can understand you Oh, can I get the window down?It's getting warmOh, can you keep your voices down?I'm tryna push recall There goes my lifeOn the open roadI'll be going homeI can understand you
