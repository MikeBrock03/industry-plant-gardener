 You're growing tired of meYou love me so hard and I still can't sleepYou're growing tired of meAnd all the things I don't talk about Sorry, I don't want your touchIt's not that I don't want youSorry, I can't take your touch It's just that I fell in love with a warAnd nobody told me it endedAnd it left a pearl in my headAnd I roll it aroundEvery night, just to watch it glowEvery night, baby, that's where I go Sorry, I don't want your touchIt's not that I don't want youSorry, I can't take your touch There's a hole that you fillYou fill, you fill
