 Let’s lay down our masksAnd be trueSo that our eyesBe bound in affectionAware of our lustAnd our shared trustWe can know each otherAnd hear nature’s wordsMy dear friend But let’s not talk this through (I used to)Cause long words widen gaps between loversWe ought to be lone, my home’s your ownUntil we have each other we’re strangers I know there’s a reasonWe use such curvesRiddles in smilesRather than small talkI know we both wantThings to be doneIn a truthful mannerThere lies our restMy dear friend
