 Recently played, shuffled againSame two songs stuck in my headI'll hear it back, don't pause the trackAlways the same, stay in my lane I can't see in outer spaceThe night is dark, nobody finds me Somewhere I heard, make up your wordsBelieve in the gods, come out on topTry to relate, predict your fateNow is the time, passing you by I can't see in outer spaceThe night is dark, my body shakes
