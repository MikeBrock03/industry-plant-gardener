Wind blows softly through the corners of my mindAnd the windows of your heart are sweetly stainedAnd will shatter in timeBut you’re no less the sweeter, “Just wait till you meet her!”I tell the boys at homeAnd my fingers’ll rust if you say that they mustSpend another night on their ownJust the thought of you my loveSends me places high above the skyWhere the wind blows gently through the corners of my mindAnd those windows of your eyes are frosted blueAs a Fitzgerald rhymeYеs I know that by dawn you’ll be woefully goneIn a sailboat fit for twoSo lеt’s drink and romance as though love had a chanceAt deceiving me and youLest your summertime perfumeFade from cherry to maroonAnd the wind blows dimly through the shutters of my mindAnd those windows I’m afraid I can’t recall ever having been mineSo let’s call it a lesson in bad first impressionsAnd in girls that win the gameFor I knew that by dawn you’d be woefully goneAnd you’ll soon not remember my name
