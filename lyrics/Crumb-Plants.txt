 Don't take me down where there's no way out, no way inThe plants can't breathe down hereEveryday there's another thing on my mindIt weights me down to the ground Tell me, tell me something sweetAnd I won't stay awayBake me, bake me up a treatAnd I can't stay away I don't have class, got a lot of time on my handsTo sit, wait around for a signLay in the grass, open up a can of a newFlavor that I've never tried Tell me, tell me something sweetWhen the day seems so longBake me, bake me up a treatI won't tell anyone
