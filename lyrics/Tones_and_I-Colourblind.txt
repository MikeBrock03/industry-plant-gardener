 Sweet talks on a Sunday afternoonNever hold you down, all the wilds and the truthAnd I know that you'll remember me‚ oh‚ back in timeBut you stay on my‚ oh, you stay on my mindWild weeks, no sleep‚ now you're colourblindBut you're always there to share a smileAnd I know sometimes get roughYou feel like you've been left behindBut you stay on my, oh, you stay on my mind But you stay on my‚ oh, you stay on my mindBut you stay on my, oh, you stay on my mindBut you stay on my, oh, you stay on my mindBut you stay on my, oh, you stay in mind Hot night, rave lights, we sit outsideBut we see more than just the starsWe're all caught up in our worriesWe forget just where we areWe forget just where we areBig steins, red wines, broken guitars'Cause we're free and we're young at, hmmAnd I know you won't remember me, oh, back in timeBut you stay on my, oh, you stay on my mind
