 Did we kiss 'cause it was dark?Or did we mean it?Was my embarrassment enoughTo make you see it?Your lips have made it toughTo keep believingYou were temporary talkTo last just for a season Hanging up the lightsWith the intensity and strifeOf your avoidance like a knifeIn my cotton candy sideI'm hoping for a fightIn this imaginary vibeThat I have caught and totemizedTo replace you when you hide So did we kiss 'cause it was dark?Or did we mean it?Was my embarrassment enoughTo make you see it?Your hands have made it toughTo keep believingYou were temporary talkTo last just for a season
