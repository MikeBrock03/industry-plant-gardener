 One morning, this sadness will fossilizeAnd I will forget how to cryI'll keep going to work, and you won't see a changeSave, perhaps, a slight gray in my eye I will go jogging routinelyCalmly and rhythmically runAnd when I find that a knife's sticking out of my sideI'll pull it out without questioning why And then, one warm summer nightI'll hear fireworks outsideAnd I'll listen to the memories as theyCry, cry, cry I will be married to silenceThe gentleman won't say a wordBut you know, oh, you know in the quiet he holdsRuns a river that will never find home And then, one warm summer nightI'll hear fireworks outsideAnd I'll listen to the memories as theyCry, cry, cry
