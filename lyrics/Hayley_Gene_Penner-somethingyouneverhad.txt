 I've been crying in airports and dying for you to come backSobbing on freeways at night like an insomniacBut somewhere on Sunset feeling you slip through my handsI thought "You can't lose something you never had" I'm counting the reasons that we ended up like we didI guess some illusions are harder to see from withinI should've noticed I built us a castle of sand'Cause I know you can't lose something you never had Some things are worth risking all your life forWorth running out into traffic to stop someone turning a car aroundAnd, oh, some things are worth running through the night forFeeling like dying, like losing a kid, or something as shit as thatNot something you never had I wake up thinking that you're gonna land at my doorTell me you know how your mom felt, suddenly sureLie on my bed and convince me you want me backAnd I'll say "You can't take back something you never had" Well some things are worth risking all your life forWorth running into a burning house just to pull someone out of the doorAnd, oh, some things are worth running through the night forFeeling like dying, like losing a kid, or something as shit as thatNot something you never had
