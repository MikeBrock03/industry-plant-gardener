 Something chronic, bit demonic, I've been on the late shift(All alone, staring at my phone)Sin and tonic, stupid promise, something like a death wish(All alone, stare into my soul) If I wanna stay alive, you should never cross my mindYeah I knew it, I've been through itIf I fall in every time, wicked love will leave me blindYeah I knew it, I've been through it Oh god, can you make my heart stop?Hit me with your killshot, babyI mean it so seriousGod, can you make my heart stop?Honey, with your killshot, babyI mean it so serious Stolen nectar, misadventure, something like a death kiss(Growing cold, under your control)Knowing better, twisted pleasure, got me feeling breathless(Growing cold, will you let me go?)
