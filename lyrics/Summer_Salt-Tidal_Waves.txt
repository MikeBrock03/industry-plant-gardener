 And as I fall from this home as a featherInto your pocket where I’ll haunt myself foreverAll of the paths that have led here now overgrowPaper planes hover 'round my windowOh What’s the day?Oh, what’s the hour?Sip on dreams I don’t recollect now, ohNot at all, not at all (Not at all)Tidal waves rip through the breezewayA year once new now far behind meMaking a few more wishes come trueWhy don’t you and I unbraidTake some time today'Til the memories fade away And now all of the songs that we’ve crewedSlowly stretch themselves out of tuneExhausted from the brawl, my top spinning to a fallLooking up words, I misspell them allYeah!
