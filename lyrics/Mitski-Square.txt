 Your room was squareI once noticed from thereIn your bed, as you sleptAnd I held my breathEverything had its own placeAnd I wondered what space would I takeIn the order you kept I tried to eat like your girlfriendJust tea, in the night I'd end upToo hungry to sleepSo lying awake, I would follow the aching insideI would findIt's for you won't be mine I tried my hardest, for I'd never learnedGod's very simple and love shouldn't burnAnd I would've offered you all that you yearned forBut I was still waiting for something to earn What is that quiet of snow in the night?The dark rings with white noiseAs you stand and drownMaybe it's all of these snowflakes, screamingA choir of muteAs they brace for the ground
