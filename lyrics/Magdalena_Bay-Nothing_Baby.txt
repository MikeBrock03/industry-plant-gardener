 You keep on running awayYou keep me out in the rainYou threw my lovin' away like I’m nothingYou're giving up nothing, babyYou keep on running awayYou keep me out in the rainYou threw my lovin' away like I’m nothingYou're giving up nothing Giving up nothing, giving up nothingGiving up, giving up, giving up nothing, babyNothing, giving up nothingGiving up, giving up, giving up nothing, baby I looked in my crystal ballAsked the mirror on the wallEvil men will always fall You keep on running awayYou keep me out in the rainYou threw my lovin' away like I'm nothingYou're giving up nothing
