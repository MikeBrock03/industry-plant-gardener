 Sun bleached flies sitting in the windowsillWaiting for the day they escapeThey talk all about that money and how their babies are always changing while they're breathing in the poison of the paintWhat I wouldn't give to be in Church this SundayListening to the choir, so heartfelt, all singingGod loves you, but not enough to save youSo, baby girl, good luck taking care of yourself So I said fine, 'cause that's how my daddy raised meIf they strike once then you just hit 'em twice as hardBut in the end, if I bend under the weight that they gave meThen this heart would break and fall as twice as far We all know how it goesThe more it hurts, the less it showsBut I still feel like they all know, and that's why I can never go back homeAnd I spend my life watching it go by from the sidelinesAnd God, I've tried, but I think it's about time I put up a fight But I don't mind 'cause that's how my daddy raised me (How my daddy raised me)If they strike once then you just hit 'em twice as hardBut I always knew that in the end no one was coming to save meSo I just prayed and I keep praying and praying and praying
