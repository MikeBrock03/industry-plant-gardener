In my sleep I heard your voice a-singin’Like a quiet call from some wide open spaceAnd as the forest seems to keep a-fallin’I bent my back to keep your corner safe.So I flew on boots of leather from MurciaTo the place where I was told they saw you last.But I was overrun by horses of ‘LusiaSo I hung from branches til they galloped past.And from where I clung all I could seeWas swallowed by the sound of you in the cherry tree.Your song was all I heardSweet Spanish bird.Maybe we could take a small siestaDown among the waves in Bay BiscayTo wash away the years of all our yearningAnd drown the sieve that sucked our time away.And victorious we’d ride in through the archwayTo greet the people who were waiting thereAnd celebrate our fortune with the farmersWho planted seeds for us inside the square.And from where I stood all I could seeWas swallowed by the sound of you in the cherry tree.Your song was all I heardSweet Spanish bird.
