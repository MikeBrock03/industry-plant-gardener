There's a lie that I told to youThat now I can't tell the truthAnd it ate me inside, so one soft drunken nightI slept with a man you knewAnd in the morning I walked home aloneAnd the businessmen saw my bonesWith my skirt in their eyes, they remembered the nightsWhen they were that man you knewYou told me onceYou were happy to have meBut I never gave me awayThere's the lie that I told to youI would give you my heart, I thinkBut it's up in a branch of a treeIt was only to tease when he climbed up the treePut my heart where I couldn't reachI didn't mind, I adored him, soWe forgot, and we left for homeAnd that was so long ago, now the tree it has grownAnd nobody knows my lover is buried undergroundNobody knows my lover is buried undergroundNobody knows my lover is buried underground
