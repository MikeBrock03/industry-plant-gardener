 Don't fall asleep yet, I'm wide awake stillI wonder if you think about me when you lay stillDon't fall asleep yet, promise you'll stay hereAre my pictures on your wall still like last year? Don't fall asleep yet, I'm wide awake stillI wonder if you think about me when you lay stillIt's been a long time, miss you around meWhen I dream about you, are you dreamin' 'bout me? Don't fall asleep, I'm wide awakeI hope that we have brighter daysYou still have my heart, so don't let it break I want you all mine foreverI'll put my heart on a projectorI wish we settled all the struggles we got intoThe best part of my life was with you Don't fall asleep yet, I'm wide awake stillI wonder if you think about me when you lay stillIt's been a long time, miss you around meWhen I dream about you, are you dreamin' 'bout me?
