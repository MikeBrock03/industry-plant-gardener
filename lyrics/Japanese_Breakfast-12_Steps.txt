 I said something cruel, I can't say I quite regret itTwelve steps into the smoking bar, I found youClothes engulfed in a bonfire, I begged you to my roomBegging still, all these years Oh, looking backHow did I keep moving?Didn't know that half of me was missingIt's easy to leave, easy to leave So tell me, "I can't blame you, we let love run its courseAnd it's a little bit lonelierI don't blame you, it's just our love ran its courseAnd that's a little bit hard" Oh, looking backWasn't a thing to keep meFrom running around in the wreckage that burned all seasonIt was easy to leave when you'd finally seen me Now tell me, "I can't blame you, it's just that love ran its courseAnd it's a little bit lonelierI don't blame you, we let love run its courseAnd it's a little bit hardI can't blame you, he's the one that you wantedSinging scenes from a restaurantI can't blame you, it's just our love ran its courseAnd it's a love that's long gone"
