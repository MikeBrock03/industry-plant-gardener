You and I walk a fragile lineI have known it all this timeBut I never thought I'd live to see it breakIt's getting dark and it's all so quiet and I can't trust anything nowAnd it's coming over you like it's all a big mistakeOh, holding my breathWon't lose you againSomething's made your eyes go coldCome on, come on, don't leave me like thisI thought I had you figured outSomething's gone terribly wrongYou're all I wantedCome on, come on, don't leave me like thisI thought I had you figured outCan't breathe whenever you're goneCan't turn back nowI'm hauntedStood there and watched you walk away from everything we hadBut I still mean every word I said to youHe will try to take away my pain and he just might make me smileBut the whole time I'm wishing he was you insteadOh, holding my breathWon't see you againSomething keeps me holding onto nothing
