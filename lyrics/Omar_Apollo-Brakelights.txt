My car is a little like youIt's not working right nowSay that we're loversAnd we miss our mothers againShe don't really like youBoy I kind of like youYou don't really like to mention that to meTell em write a haiku cuzNo one really likes meI'm getting used to thatDays by, baby I don't got no brake lightsMy car turns off when I go fastWhy would you want meDays by, baby I don't got no brake lightsMy car turns off when I go fastWhy would you want meDays by, I'm losing the sunriseI'll fall close to youLosing my mind
