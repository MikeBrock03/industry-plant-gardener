 (Look what you did to me)(Look how you broke my heart)Yeah, I don't like you anymore Dusk 'til dawnAvoiding eye contactIf our eyes metAll the feelings will flood back inFlood back againFlood back againDusk 'til dawnAvoiding love songs'Cause you stole my heartBut my feelings haven't gone awayI can feel it stillI can feel it allDon't look at me I'm fineBeen through this a hundred timesJust another break-upI'll face itCall it the finish line
