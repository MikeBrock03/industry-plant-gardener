 Only call me when you need someone to talk toOnly phone me when your baby doesn't call youNever answer 'less you're feeling lonelyPhone only rings when she's driving you crazyOnly call me when you're in distressYour heart's in two and your life's a messI would call you every hour every dayIf you give me your heart, if you call me baby Said you'll call me everydayWe both know you won'tYou said you'd keep me from all harmThough you hurt me the mostI know I, know I shouldn't stayBut the way you say, way you say myName, I think you've changedWhen you're exactly the same, exactly the sameTwo steps forwardOne step backTwo steps forwardOne step back Only call me when you're feeling blueAnd I've been the same way since I fell for youNever call unless you need somebodyAnd I'll always need you more than you could need meWish you'd hold me 'stead of putting me on holdWhen we talk on the telephoneAnd I would call you every hour, every dayIf you'd give me your heartIf you'd call me baby
