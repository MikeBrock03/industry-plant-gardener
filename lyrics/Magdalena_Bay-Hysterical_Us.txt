 Down the roadWhere the kids don't play aloneOr in your homeThere's a fogIt's a shadow, a smoking gunThat something is wrongUh! Hysterical usSucking in oxygenHow did we learn to breathe?Are we alone?Are we in love again?What do you want from me?Hysterical usChecking the locks againRemember when we could sleep?Are we alone?Are we in love again?What do you want from me? Play it coolPlay the man who won't play the foolBut they're playing you'Til in the skyThirty-еight green blinding lightsAre here to takе you homeAh!
