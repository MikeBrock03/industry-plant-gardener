 Please, pleaseBelieve in, all night 'Cause I really don't wanna be here aloneToo many people I don't see no moreToo many feelings I don't feel no more'Cause I really don't wanna be here aloneToo many people I don't need no moreSo many doubts that I stop keeping score Remember when you told me that I ain't lonely?You used to hold meYou always was the one to make up reasons quickAnd I would be the one to believe in it FaceTime, me just to pass timeBut I still rewind what you said last nightYou said that you would always have some reasoningHow come you only did that on the weekend, then? Don't take this personallyI just can't be the person you needWhat we got ain't working for meAnd all it ever did was change the person in meDon't take this personallyI just can't be the person you needWhat we got ain't working for meAll it ever did was change the person in me
