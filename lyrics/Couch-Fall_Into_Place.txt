 This is some tricky territoryToo many roads for me to walkWears down my bones but they‘re not broken‘Cause I‘ve got some plans for where I‘m goingSomeone is twisting my right arm behind my backAnd yanking them a-left So everyday we think on what we‘ve doneLaughing at our fearsAnd fearing what‘s to comeHey, I know it‘s hardIt‘s hard to find the peace in opportunityLet it all fall into place Taking decisive for indifferentThat‘s how to take the pressure offThe time to choose will simmer low and circle backThe traces of a theft So everyday we think on what we‘ve doneLaughing at our fearsAnd fearing what‘s to comeHey, I know it‘s hardIt‘s hard to find the peace in opportunityLet it all fall into place
