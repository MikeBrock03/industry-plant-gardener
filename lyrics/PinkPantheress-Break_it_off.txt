 No one ever saw me cryUntil I left the party the other nightDo you remember all the things that you said to me?That came out of his mouth automatically But I'm so used to saying"I’m fine"And then something that you did to hurt me worse, it comes to meDespite (Those times)One day I just wanna hear you say"I like you" What's stopping you? (Hey)Ah, what's stopping you?What’s stopping you?Ah, what's stopping you? Wish I could go back to lying beside you on the bedWhy'd you, oh, why'd you break it off? (What's stopping you?)I lie here thinking 'bout every bad mistake I've madеWhy'd you, oh, why’d you break it off?
