I feel your hand close to mineAnd your smile is easy to findSo I'll hide this fearThat you're not really hereAnd I will laugh with youKiss your cheek like you still want me toAnd though you're near, I knowThat you're not really hereSo I'll wait for a sign that says it's not too lateAnd I'll try to save the love that once was mineAnd I'll find, I'll find your broken light that used to shineAnd I'll find, I'll find youAnd I kept your heartOn a chain around my neckAnd you swore to me "forever"But forever fell apartBut I'll wait for a sign that says it's not too lateAnd I'll try to save the love that once was mineAnd I'll find, I'll find your broken light that used to shineAnd I'll find, I'll find youSo come back to meI've saved your promises in a box beneath my bedNow your touch is like a memoryAnd your words are my souvenir
