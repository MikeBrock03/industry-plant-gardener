 I'll live in the bathtubIt's cool and cleanIt's smooth and it's steadyIt's all that I needI broke our belongingsThey're all on the floorThe room is now emptyNothing left to throw All the eggshells are on the groundAnd I try, I'm trying to pick them upBut they crack and crumble, it's all too muchToo frail for me to touchAll the eggshells are on the groundAnd I try, I'm trying to pick them upBut they crack and crumble, it's all too muchToo frail for me to touch I'll live in the bathtubSurrounded by tilesAll so square and so steadyI will die in their cool, cool armsI broke what you gave meBut you kept giving moreAnd I'm sorry for takingBut I keep wanting more, more, more, oh
