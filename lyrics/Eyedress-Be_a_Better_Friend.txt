 All my friends are aliveLet's not waste our timeWith these stupid guysLet's enjoy our livesI'm so hurt insideBut I still try to smile'Cause I've got you'Cause I've got you'Cause I've got youI know what you're going throughIt hurts and I feel for youI know how you feel insideBut you always smileFor the cameraYou're still having funTaking too much drugsI know how it feels to be downI wanna be a better friendMy life is getting darkMy life is getting dark I know what you're going throughJust call me I'm coming throughI'll stay up and talk to youYou know I'm good for youI'm goodI'm goodI'm goodI'm goodI'm goodI'm goodI'm goodI'm goodI'm goodI'm goodI'm goodI'm good
