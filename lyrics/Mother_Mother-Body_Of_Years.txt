 All the remains of a cadaver of daysI keep hidden away, keep them there just in caseI wanna visit that place, blow the dust from the bonesOff a body of years that I leave all alone Just a body of years See the skin disappears and the blood turns to stoneIn a body of years, now a pile of bonesLike a sheet of veneer, each a piece of my soulIt's a body of years, that I leave all alone It's just a body of years, now a pile of bonesYou know Old soul who falls downCan't stop trippin' on theseOld roads I go downGet back up and Get my foot in the door and my face on the pageMake my mark in the world with a bat and a bladeIt's a body of work that you can't ever changeLike a body of years that you take to your grave
