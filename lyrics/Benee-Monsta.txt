 I'm tryna fall asleepSomething doesn't feel rightA chill crawls up my skinA tinglin' down my limbsA shadow in the nightMy God, it gave me such a frightI see him standing right outsideHis face is red, his eyes are white What is it that he wants from me?Maybe he just feels lonelyWhat is it that he has in mind?Why has he come here at this time? The monster takes me awayFrom my safe spaceInto the nightThe monster takes me awayFrom my safe spaceInto the night Wake up in a magic caveHere's me trying to be braveBut then instead of eatin' meHe offers me a blueberry
