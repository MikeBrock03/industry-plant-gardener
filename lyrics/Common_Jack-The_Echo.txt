 I can't catch a breakBecause it seems that it would takeSome luck.It lights your face, it lights the night,We lose the phosphorescent fight,We run. The echo sounds.The echo sounds. I'd rather be an enemyThan some forgotten memoryOf yours.I'm yours.Should I have changed myself for youWould we have even made throughOr would we walk as liars do,Alone? The echo sounds.The echo sounds.The echo sounds.The echo sounds.The echo sounds.The echo sounds.
