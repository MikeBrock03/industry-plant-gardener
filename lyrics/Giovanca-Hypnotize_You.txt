If u only were mineMine you'd be foreverI could hypnotize uU will never leave my sideOh I, understandYou've got your lifeYou've got your business, got your friendsBut i just wanna be with you alwaysWant to catch u, like a butterflyI will put you in a box so that no one can see uI'd feed you i'd bath you, you will be okaySee the world from my pocket, now dont be afraidI'm not crazy, i just love youIf u only were mineMine you'd be foreverI could hypnotize uU will never leave my sideOh it, may sound strangeBut loving u is someting that i couldn't changeAnd since i dont believe in potionsI hypnotize u with emotions
