 I'll hide and you'll chaseI'll say that everything's different nowBut we haven't really changed muchAround us the world's grown upWe're staying up late, alwaysYeah, we're still running 'round the houseFinding ghosts in the basementAnd places to hide with you Hideaway, you want it like yesterdayI'm just a little bit old, just a little bit cold, but I still want you closeHideaway, you want it like yesterdayI'm just a little bit old, just a little bit cold, but I still want you close Sometimes I'm frozen in placeNow and then I'm frightened by the darkCreepy stairs in the hallwayAround me the world's grown upYou're still the same in all the good waysYeah, you still whistle when you laughCrooked smile turns me sidewaysI tumble through time with you
