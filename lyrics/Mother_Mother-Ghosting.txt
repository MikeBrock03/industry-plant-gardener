 I've been ghosting, I've been ghosting alongGhost in your house, ghost in your armsWhen you're tossing, when you turn in your sleepIt's because I'm ghosting your dreams And this is why I have decidedTo pull these old white sheets from my headI'll leave them folded neat and tidySo that you'll know I'm out of hidingYeah I've been ghosting, I've been ghosting aloneGhost in the world, ghost with no homeI remember, I remember the daysWhen I'd make you oh-so afraid And this is why I have decidedTo leave your house and home unhauntedYou don't need poltergeists for sidekicksYou don't need treats and you don't need tricks You don't need treats, you don't need tricksYou don't need no HalloweenYou don't need treats, you don't need tricksAnd you don't need meMe
