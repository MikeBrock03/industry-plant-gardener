 Remember every move you made as if it was still trueIt's there I am king, there I feel brand new ‘Cause you’re in my soul, can’t let you go, fighting for youAnd in my dreams, I’ll make you appear, oh oh ohAs we move closer and I groove with youBlue and green rays, they shine through, heyFeel the energy, you don’t have to tryYou can see it in our bodies, you can see it in our eyes Watch me dance with this memoryJust as real, just as heavenlyWatch me dance in my reverieThe lights decay but the love remainsWatch me dance with this memoryJust as real, just as heavenlyWatch me dance in my reverieThe lights decay but my love remains  In the mist of the crowded room, you might have flownBut all I see is you and you alone
