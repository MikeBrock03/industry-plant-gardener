I miss youEvery morning every nightHow I wish youWould wake up and see my sight'Cause I'm back home in CanadaThinking how you'd fit hereSinging with my father, playing his guitars and driving to the cottageHolding on to August, saying you were ready and you didn't understandAnd I miss youEvery Sunday afternoon'Cause we used to take your truck to MalibuAnd I'm missing you from CanadaKeeping up my silenceThinking if I'm quiet, you might find your senses and fill in all the distancesShow up at my doorstep, interrupt our dinner and tell me you were wrongAnd I'm not staying quiet to punish youNo, I just thought I might need less of youAnd I miss youEvery time I hear your name'Cause I'm used to how it looks and sounds and tastes
