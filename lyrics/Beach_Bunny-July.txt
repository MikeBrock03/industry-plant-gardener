 In July, the sun was highThe world was meltingThrough the sky Who am I?Sometimes I get a little paranoidTryin' to figure it outSun sets, only through the daylightAt night, what does it become? In July, we ran awayThrough hurricanes and tidal wavesSunburnt smiles, freckled faceOur heads were filled with outer spaceIn July, the sun the was highThe world was melting through the skyWe wore laughter in our eyesEverything is alright Who are you?Well, I can't explain itSomething moreThan I've seen beforeWe are moons on the horizonYou're a waveBreaking against the shore
