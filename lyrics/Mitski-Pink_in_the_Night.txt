 I glow pink in the night in my roomI've been blossoming alone over youAnd I hear my heart breaking tonightI hear my heart breaking tonight Ooh, do you hear it too?It's like a summer shower With every drop of rain singing"I love you, I love you, I love youI love you, I love you, I love youI love you, I love you, I love you" I could stare at your back all dayI could stare at your back all day And I know I've kissed you before, but I didn't do it rightCan I try again, try again, try againTry again, and again, and againAnd again, and again, and again?
