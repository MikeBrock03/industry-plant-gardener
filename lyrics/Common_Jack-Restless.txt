[Verse 1]Please excuse my style todayIt’s not that i don’t care it’s just a phaseThe restless dog is at my heelsNipping, biting, no matter how i prayThe more i try to use my eyesThe more i see the picture start to frayThe moon becomes the sun becomes the moon againThe pendulum will sway[Chorus]It swings swings swingsSwings so hardIt hits hits hitsIt hits so hard[Verse 2]My mind goes walking through itselfLooking for the water in the wellBut he don’t know the well’s got legsAnd keeps his secret safely from the swellSo please excuse my mood todayIt’s not that i’m unkind i just tend to dwellOn everything outside of meAnd all the stories you will never tell
