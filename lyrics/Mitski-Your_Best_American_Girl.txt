 If I could, I'd be your little spoonAnd kiss your fingers forevermoreBut, big spoon, you have so much to doAnd I have nothing ahead of me You're the sun, you've never seen the nightBut you hear its song from the morning birdsWell, I'm not the moon, I'm not even a starBut awake at night I'll be singing to the birds Don't wait for me, I can't come Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised meBut I do, I think I doAnd you're an all-American boyI guess I couldn't help trying to be your best American girl You're the oneYou're all I ever wantedI think I'll regret this
