 Under millions of milesOf blind snakes and profilesThis love is dead yet still breathingWhile I sit in the bathroomDry heavingLast night's terrible decisionsStand with the sun's inhibitionsA heart-broken method rageWilled by whisky and a coming of age This love is suffocating in the smokeIt may be done for goodBut I don’t know And while this loveMay be sarcasticAt least it’s folkAt least it’s folkNobody has to knowNobody has to know My youth has turned me angryMy anger's made me weirdI enjoy the fakings and the take me’sThis world's romance isAre all but seared
