[Verse 1]Under millions of milesOf blind snakes and profilesThis love is dead yet still breathingWhile I sit in the bathroomDry heavingLast night's terrible decisionsStand with the sun's inhibitionsA heart-broken method rageWilled by whisky and a coming of age[Pre-Chorus]This love is suffocating in the smokeIt may be done for goodBut I don’t know[Chorus]And while this loveMay be sarcasticAt least it’s folkAt least it’s folkNobody has to knowNobody has to know[Verse 2]My youth has turned me angryMy anger's made me weirdI enjoy the fakings and the take me’sThis world's romance isAre all but seared
