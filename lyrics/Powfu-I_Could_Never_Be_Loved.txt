 I could never be lovedI could never be lovedI could never, could be loved It's been like 3 months of no talkingWalking by myself, no more eyes to get lost inKeep on looking back all the time I'll be honestI hate being alone at least I got my conscienceSince you left me here, locked up in my roomWriting all these songsWake up every morningAnd turn my computer onBecause how else do I dealWith these thoughts of you and me?I was on the cloudsNow I'm spiraling into the seaI wrote a message for youBut I couldn’t send it, I regret it yuhI'm sorry I’m patheticWhat's this? caught a sicknessAnd won’t be getting betterThe sun might be shiningBut it feels like rainy weather
