You can walk away from all of thisOr you can let me show you 'round the wreckageSome of this is harder to admit to talk about but I am tryingGiving in is harder to resistFeeling like a boat without an anchorStolen silent kisses feel like quiet promises that I'll be fineAnd I'm trying to pull away from this bedBut it hasn't happened yetAnd I lie when I say I'll never go back'Cause it hasn't worked like thatSo hate me if you want toYou can blame me if it helps youBreaking up your family while a siren wakes the baby, it's alrightWhatever helps you sleep at nightWhatever helps you sleep at nightAnd I'm not sure how you are taking thisPlaying with a tiny piece of paperScared to see my lying eyes are the only eyes not telling lies nowAnd I've got my reasons for the messBut none of them will save you from your madness'Cause he was in my body while his words were in your handsSomewhere across the ocean trusting him
