I want to stay South of the RiverWith the chains and the goldWe could be out here together;But, you have places to goWatching the sunshine blaze the grayI don't know why you wouldn't stayYou should come South of the RiverWhere the loving is goldYou should come South of the RiverThis is where it all startsI think that we could stay here foreverLie on the roof til' it's darkAnd when the last bus pulls awayI swear that I almost heard you say"I should move South of the River."I want to get to knowI want to get to know, ohI want to stay South of the River
