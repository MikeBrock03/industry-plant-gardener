 I've got thoughts in my headThatWon’t go awayGot my love in my bedBut theyDon’t ever seem to changeThoughts in my headThatWon’t go awayGot my love in his bedAnd she’sGot something good for a change I just wanna see you for the first timeGot me up all night through the daytimeI just wanna chill gotta make timeI would speak up but i’m too shyLike whyI just need to open up, oh myHit you on your phone but you’re bone dryPeople change, rearrange right in front of your eyesSwitch up now I bet she on to new guysI swear nothing change, but the pocket changeYou been acting strange, you been acting strangeI thought you out of range, you were out of rangeIgnore me for those days, yeah for all those daysLeaving me read, like I never saidAnything to hurt you, got me feeling deadI wish I could go back and just tell you thatEverything I said I didn’t mean it yet
