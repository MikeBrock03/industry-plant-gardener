I took my love and took it downI climbed a mountain and I turned aroundAnd I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hillsTill the landslide brought me downOh, mirror in the sky, what is love?Can the child within my heart rise above?Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?Can I handle the seasons of my life?Well, I've been afraid of changing'Cause I've built my life around youBut time makes you bolderEven children get olderAnd I'm getting older tooWell, I've been afraid of changing'Cause I've built my life around youBut time makes you bolderEven children get olderAnd I'm getting older tooOh, I'm getting older tooI take my love, take it downI climb a mountain and turn aroundAnd if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hillsWill the landslide bring you downAnd if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hillsWill the landslide bring you down, oh, ohThe landslide bring you down
