I'm too depressed to careI'm too poor to go anywhereI'm so alone, no one's thereI can't even tell my friends how I feelAfraid they don't wanna hear itAfraid they don't knowBut it's alright because I'm strongThey think I'm invincibleHe don't wanna work it outThinks he'd rather be aloneI don't know what to doThese shoes are getting way too bigI hope that I can feed my kidI hope that I can feed my kidShe isn't even a year oldI already wanna kill myselfHope that I can watch you growHope that I don't kill myselfI hate myselfNo one even calls meBut that's alright with meI'd rather die in peaceHe don't wanna work it outThinks he'd rather be aloneI don't know what to doThese shoes are getting way too bigI hope that I can feed my kidI hope that I can feed my kid
