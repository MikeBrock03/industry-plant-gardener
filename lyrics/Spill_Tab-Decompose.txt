 In our picket fenced homeI’ll set dinner on the stoveAnd the kids are running rogueAnd these pills are hittin’ slowSix o’clock unlock the doorCome inside and chat some moreYou say something I ignoreThere goes dinner on the floor I’ve not forgottenThat we’ve become rottenI’ve not forgottenYour words when I take themUgly and honestOur bed like an officeBut I’ve not forgottenThat we’ve become rotten As our skin melts off the boneIn the soil decomposeAnd our body feeds the growthWhen the sunlight burns the snow
