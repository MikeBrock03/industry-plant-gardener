 The sun is falling nowSeems like you left the townWhy would you ever leave us?Well, it's nothing to discuss'Cause I know that it's over We won't forget you now'Cause you'll be right backAm I wrongAm I wrong saying we will see you soon These memories will fadeThe sun won't shine todayMy body starts to get painNot going anywhereThere's nothing left to say'Cause I know that it's over  x2We won't forget you now'Cause you'll be right backHere again, here again with usWe can't wait to see the flowersAnd when that time is hereWe'll be so glad to get outGet out when you come back to usAnd hang out for those months ofHang out for those months of time
