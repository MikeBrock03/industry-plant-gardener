 It was dawn and IWaited on the filterSo to typifySaid she called me misterUnder misty skiesHit to get there quickerRebel through the night'Cuz I truly missed herUniversal charm'Cuz she thinks it’s humourAnd I mean no harmLie down into thisFall back she saysLet’s just keep this mutualIt’s these lines I dreadToo much life force simple As the night awaitsI can see her sleepingStare down mistakeDoes she know my secret?I’m in love with herLet the love manifestWatch me take my serveWatch me take controlShe doesn’t know what hit herGlimpses of her soulAs a seamless dinnerNumbers on the plateIt’s my turn nowOne minute to the hour yeah
