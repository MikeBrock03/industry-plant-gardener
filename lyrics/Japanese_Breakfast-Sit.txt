 Hear my name in your mouth and I'm done forSay to sit on your face in O's and onesIt's a chase sequence on loopIt's the life that you chose and it kills me Caught up in the idea of someoneCaught up in the idea of youThat's done too soon It's your name in my mouth I'm repeatingIt's the taste of your tongue I can't spit outI keep watching the way he looks through youI keep watching your ways, I miss it all Caught up in the idea of someoneCaught up in the idea of youThat's gone too soon
