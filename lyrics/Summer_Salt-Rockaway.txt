I’ll try again this summerAlways fighting just to win your timeWell so long agoIt’s now a memoryHaunting me all the whileAnd now it’s just the jealousyTaking a hold of meI see you as you rockawayAnd I sit around and roll the dayWell so long to meIt’s not enoughTo keep us from hanging aroundWell now it’s just the jealousyTaking its toll on meNow of all the days I’ve spent wasted with youAfter all I think its time I move onBut I don’t know where to goFor without you I feel I’d always borough at home
