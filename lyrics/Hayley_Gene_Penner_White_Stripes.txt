We used to lie awake in the back of
Your car listenin' to the White Stripes
I used to make you laugh 'til it
Hurt your sides and we didn't know why
Now, look how nothing has changed
Only time, only money, and we're a little older
But still we're lyin' awake in the back
Of your car with my head on your shoulder
[Chorus]
'Cause we know that don't mean nothing 'cause never is just a
Word that people throw back at each other when nothing seems to work
And I don't know where this is heading or how our story ends
But I know right now we'rе together and that's really all thеre is
[Verse 2]
We used to lie awake in the back of
My yard listenin' to the White Stripes
I used to trace the stars like the
Curve of your mouth, oh, in the moonlight
Now look how nothing has changed
Only time, only money, and we're a little wounded
But still we're lyin' awake in the
Back of my yard like we're never movin'
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause we know that don't mean nothing 'cause never is just a
Word that people throw back at each other when nothing seems to work
And I don't know where this is heading or how our story ends
But I know right now we're together and that's really all there is
[Bridge]
Oh, look at me falling for you
Like I've done a thousand times, a thousand times, oh
And if we're divided in two
I might find you down the line and fall another time
[Chorus]
'Cause we know that don't mean nothing 'cause never is just a
Word that people throw back at each other when nothing seems to work
And I don't know where this is heading or how our story ends
But I know right now we're together and that's really all there is
[Outro]
All there is
All there is
All there is
All there is
We used to lie awake in the back of
Your car, listenin' to the White Stripes
We used to lie awake in the back of
Your car, listenin' to the White Stripes
OhEmbed
