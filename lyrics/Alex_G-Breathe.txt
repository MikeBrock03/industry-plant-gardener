 I want to meet himCan't wait to see himHe looks like something that I'd see in a museumHis thoughts are emptyHe's lookin' dirtyAnd I could hurt him 'cause I know he wouldn't stop me But you don't need to feel so upsetDon't talk to me and pretend you careHe's not here, he's not there, he's not anywhere I've got a notionThere's no emotionHe's just an auto-response to the commotionHe's got no futureHe's just a loserThere are no meds to pull his head out of the sеwerYou've got his numberHе's like a sunburnHe'll always itch until you scratchYou'll never learn Don't forget, that it's all in your headDon't look at me and pretend you careI'm not here, I'm not there, I'm not anywhere
