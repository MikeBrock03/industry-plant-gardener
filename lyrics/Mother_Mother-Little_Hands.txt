 My baby's gone like a flamePut out by the rain, water down the drainLittle face, little feet, little hands in my mindWhere I'm crying all the time, where I'm crying all the time Little face, little feet, little hands in my brainDriving me insane, driving me insaneLittle face, little feet, little hands not aroundNo more little sounds, no more little sound My baby's gone like a flamePut out by the rain, water down the drain Ah-ah ah-ah-ahAh-ah ah-ah-ah-ahAh-ah ah-ah-ahAh-ah ha-ah-ah-ahAh-ah ah-ah-ahAh-ah ah-ah-ah-ahAh-ah ah-ah-ahAh-ah ha-ah-ah-ah
