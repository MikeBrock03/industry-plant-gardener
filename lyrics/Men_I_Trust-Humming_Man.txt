 Amid the gate, he stares at my doorHow long did I see him stay?Days or months, I couldn't sayYet it bustles me, and what for? I swear I saw him moanBut my window's thick and cloudyAnd I wonâ€™t disdain a sentry's dutyFleeing my home for venture lone Amid the gate, he stares at my doorHow long did I see him stay?Days or months, I couldn't sayYet it bustles me, and what for? That drone haunts me from abroadA middle tone, a new normA safe zone, applauding formMy yard is steep and deep, thank God You moanI saw you moanYou moanI saw you moan
