[Verse 1]And then I saw my swollen faceDancing on the swollen lake.I ran from the wind and skyAs I tried to hide,But my arms opened wide.We threw our wishes to the flames,Your lovely smile gave mine a lovely name,Oh to be the wind and skyAs I dug a holeTo the secret of the bowl.[Chorus]Oh I feel a touch of graceAs we are dancing in this holy place.[Verse 2]I felt your breath warm upon the swell,We circled the moon before we fell,We laughed at the wind and skyAs they tried to be you and me.[Chorus]Oh I feel a touch of graceAs we are dancing in this holy place.Do you hear the siren songSinging through the air?Won't you take my hand and lead me there?
