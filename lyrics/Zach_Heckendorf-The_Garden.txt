I got one on the ground, one in the graveOne in the sky and one on the wayI'll find a womb to crawl up inSo I can pop out, be born againMy mind's on the prize, but my hearts in the wayAnd I think I have a tendency to throw it all awayBut I don't really give a shit, cause I'm a hypocriteGet what I get and don't throw a fitBut I don't want none of itOh well, it's whateverThere ain't no use in worrying about the warm weatherBut one thing's for sureI'mma fight till the very endSo if you are alive thenTake a breath of fresh airAt the bottom of HellWill the garden grow there?Where soon we will becomeEverything that we said we would stay away fromWe are the mountains turned to grains of sandWe would rather die than let these people take our landWe are the battle wed, we are the sick and damnedWe are abundant love
