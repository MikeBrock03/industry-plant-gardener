I've been so close to leaving but you get in the way
You know I just want to stay around you
I hope you know what you're holding before it's too late
Don't let me get away, get away, get away
[Verse 1]
Oh, I'm trying to find the patience not to run from this
And I'm trying, but you take your love the way you offer it, mm
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, why is it my job to teach you how to love me?
Why can't I just love you?
Oh, I'm putting up a fight
So you know that I fought for you
[Chorus]
I've been so close to leaving but you get in the way
You know I just want to stay around you
I hope you know what you're holding before it's too late
Don't let me get away, get away, get away
Oh, I wanna beliеve you're gonna suddenly changе
You know I just wanna lay beside you
I hope you know what you're holding before somebody says
How did she get away, get away, get away?

Oh, we go from taking photographs and making plans
To who knows, you must have reasons that you're holding back
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, why is it my job to teach you how to love me?
Why don't you know how to?
Oh, I'm giving you a chance
To show me that you're fighting too
[Chorus]
I've been so close to leaving but you get in the way
You know I just want to stay around you
I hope you know what you're holding before it's too late
Don't let me get away, get away, get away
Oh, I wanna believe you're gonna suddenly change
You know I just wanna lay beside you
I hope you know what you're holding before somebody says
How did she get away, get away, get away?
How did she get away, get away, get away?Embed
