On your streetLovers fade lovers meetEvery nightSomeone new passes byEvery nightUp your stairsDown the hallSee you thereIn your eyesSomeone I recogniseIn your eyesAnd I like it in hereI love it alreadyYour cigarettes burnsJust rightAnd oh I'm not scared of my fearI fought her alreadyAnd she isn't here tonightBut I know that we can't stay right here'Cause I know we all just disappearAnd I know the moment you know thе momentThe moment is gonеStill I wanna hold onHold on
