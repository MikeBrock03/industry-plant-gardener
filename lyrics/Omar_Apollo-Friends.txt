 You know, I thought that we could be friendsBut now I’m caught up in this messI can’t pretend, that I don’t feel this'Cause if I don’t, it’ll leave me depressedAnd I know it don’t make no senseBut I’m getting used to thisAnd I’m older now, but I’m still youngAnd I got many, oh many years to come You just thought I just wanted to be friendsYou just thought I just wanted to be friends And I never said it out loudI’d end up looking like the foolAm I the only one afraid to make a moveMaybe you're feeling what I’m feeling, tooAnd I know it don’t make no senseBut I’m getting used to thisAnd I’m older now, but I’m still youngAnd I got many, oh, many years to come You just thought I just wanted to be friendsYou just thought I just wanted to be friends
