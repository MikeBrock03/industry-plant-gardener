[Verse 1]Far awayLosing track of timeSmoking cigars we dipped in honeyFinding new ways to spend our moneyAlong the wayTrying to read the signsWalking the backstreets and pathwaysPast the tobacco fields and bad days[Pre-Chorus]All the way out hereYou could almost start forgetting thingsAre not as they appear[Chorus]Driving west down the mountain rangeWell I never could quite get its name rightCause you're catching my eyeUnder an open skyIn the backseat of an old sedan that ran along the seasideTo ease our lonely minds, oh honey[Verse 2]It was a dreamMusic floated upWas it all a scene of distant loversWere we only hiding under covers?
