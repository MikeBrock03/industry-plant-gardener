 I know it's getting hardThere's so much you're holding inAnd your heart is feeling fragileWhen the night is closing inStill, I stand by what I saidThere's no other place to startThan with your weary feet beneath youClimbing canyons in the dark You and I were following the signs we found outsideThey only were leading each of us to run and hide Again I'm standing at your doorHave I always been naive?Well on second thought don't answer thatI see it on my sleeveI've been looking for a stormSo one is always blowing inAnd my heart is feeling fragileWhen the night is closing in
