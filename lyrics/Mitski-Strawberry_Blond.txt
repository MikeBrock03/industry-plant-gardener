 I love everybody because I love youWhen you stood up, walked away barefootAnd the grass where you lay left a bed in your shapeI looked over it and I ached I love everybody because I love youI don't need the city and I don't need proofAll I need, darling, is a life in your shapeI picture it soft and I ache Look at you, strawberry blond Reach out the car window, trying to hold the windYou tell me you love her, I give you a grinOh, all I ever wanted was a life in your shapeSo, I follow the white lines, follow the white lines Keep my eyes on the road as I ache Look at you, strawberry blond, fields rolling onI love it when you call my nameCan you hear the bumblebees swarm? Watching your armI love it when you look my wayLook at you, strawberry blond, fields rolling onI love it when you call my nameCan you hear the bumblebees swarm? Watching your armI love it when you look my way
