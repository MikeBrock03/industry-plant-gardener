 Falling apart, I'm falling apartHer ocean eyes, they stole my heartI know it’s hard, I know it's hardWill this ever end? I don't know where to start Every day I think of you, old shit that we used to doSilhouettes underneath the moonBlack night but the sky was blueI hit hard when it suddenly changedLove that we had all thrown awayTake it back if I couldBut I’m caught in a trap that I can't escapeGone, yeah, the loneliness-killer called loveNow it's gone, yeahThe touch of your skin, the warmth of your bloodI tried to forget all of this, but it's hard after all that we didI tried to forget all of this'Cause the thought of you is making me sick I'm missing little things that you sayAll the times you call my nameWhen you laughed at the jokes I madeThat happiness no one could takeMe and you making new memories dailyBut without you, I haven't made any latelyI'm watching your favorite moviesPraying you’re in heaven safely, yeah
