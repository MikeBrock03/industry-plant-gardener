 Back when the year had a one in frontBack to pretend and lost kingdomsStanding tall as some tree stumps, we'd just begunNowhere to hide, nowhere to runThose pots and pans felt like our drumsWe'd get lost under the sunWe'd just begunSometimes i sure do miss those daysRoam outside and go and playBig wheels and birthday cakesIt was all okayLive and learned from our mistakesSome will fade and some will stayBroke away from yesterdayAnd it's all okayAnd it's all okay Never woke up before noonCereal and old cartoonsLazy days and pajama blues, nothing to loseEvery old place felt brand newNever wondered who was whoJust some kids with sticks and glue, nothing to loseNowadays it's all replayYouth still in our dnaFind a spot to go sit and layAnd we'll wash awayNever trade these summer daysSame kids as yesterdaySand castles on the bayAnd we'll wash awayAnd we'll wash away
