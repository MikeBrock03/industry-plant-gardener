Slavery's like fire and cold ice;You can either burn or slip and slideLet me sort by impulse and negotiate your fateSilver lining looks like it's coated with golden platesSeems we both have wondered if all of this existsNot a place as intricate as this...Well, I can see your face in all the right places;Think you're what my reality is laced withAnd if you take sides, then please take mine'Cause if I'm in it, I'm in it to inhibitEverything you're holding backSlavery's like iron and cheap wine;Cuts you when your blood is alcohol-linedStuffed under the surface to hold up the world's weightThe breath you took leaks from your lungs at a constant rateSeems we both have wondered if all of this existsNot a place as intricate as this...Well, I can see your face in all the right places;Think you're what my reality is laced withAnd if you take sides, then please take mine'Cause if I'm in it, I'm in it to inhibitEverything you're holding back
