 Did you ever want me? No worries if notIt's just that I told my mum, she thinks we're still going strongShe knows that I'm so fond of you that she can't ignoreHow every day she knocks, but I don't answer my doorEvery time I look outside my house, I try to make myself believe(I can look at nature and feel good again)You just call and text to say, "I want to talk," but I'm too scared to meet(Is that why you think the worst of me?) Say we'll make upWhy'd you say that?Why'd you break her?('Cause I never got to teach myself at all)How to not show myself let go?All my friends knowThat you think the worst of me Even though you broke my heartNow we're living worlds apartNow I've blocked you since I'm smart(Never got to teach myself at all)Now that all that's done and saidI see all the time I spentNot talking to my best friend'Cause I thought the worst of me
