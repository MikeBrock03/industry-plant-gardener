 You, you sayYou wanna go far awayI wanna know the place you craveIs everything different or the same? I'm running out of my time, a flower gone dryYour lips touching mine won't doOnly what's left of my pride could lust for a lieYou aim, you attack, you lose You say that you trust in meAnd I say that I disagree I'm out of my time, I'm lost in the crimeYour lips touching mine won't doOnly what's left of my pride could fall for a lieYou aim, you attack, you loseYou lose You, you playBut there are no winners in the gameI wanna know the final stageWhere we go when the curtain fades
