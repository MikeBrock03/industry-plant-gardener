 Like where was ICan’t find my selfPlease don’t blow my highScreaming fuck my health She like what do you meanBaby look in my eyesIf you’ve seen what I seenTake a step in my mindWhere do I goHide me from your white liesDo you love me i don’t knowShe a demon in disguise I don’t want to love no moreBaby girl don’t seem convincingBut I gotta trust my instinctsThings ain’t what it seemsMake it feel like somethings missingFist against the paintThe wall is what my fist is kissingMind tell me to leave but my heart keep saying fuck itFeelings hard to duck it she come back A nigga love itShe held my soul as captive,put my heart inside her bucketUsed me as her choir she and had satan conduct it
