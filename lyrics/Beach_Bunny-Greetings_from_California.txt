 When I shatter into pieces, will you be the reason I fall apart?Haven't done much sleeping 'cause lately I've been dreaming you'll break my heartWake up in the morning, mourning in the eveningSymptoms got me thinking that I'm catching feelingsStaring at the ceiling, counting reasons why I need to get out I think we're heading southI think we're heading nowhereWherever you areI wanna be thereWhen you're not aroundThere's no soundThere's no airAnd I keep on falling downJust to get back on my feet again My laugh cracked in half when you started seeing somebody newI'm not the jealous type, but I've never met somebody like youThough you didn't specifyI could see it in your eyesShe's the one you needed, now I'm calculating reasons to get out I think we're heading southI think we're heading nowhereWherever you areI wanna be thereWhen you're not aroundThere's no soundThere's no airAnd I keep on falling downJust to get back on my feet again
