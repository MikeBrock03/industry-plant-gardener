[Verse 1]Eli Fletcher was a fine fine manBorn to a woman who was fine as sandIn the mountains on a Blue Ridge Breeze,He grew up beneath the dogwood trees.A high school hero of the football team,He stuck around for his brunette dream.His shoulders broad & his cheekbones high,He made you feel he could kiss the sky.[Verse 2]One Sunday night I found him in town,Drunk on whiskey and his own renown,Telling tales of glory days,Of good ol’ boys & their good ol’ ways.We sate for hours and chewed the fatGrowing older where our fathers sat.& after a while, he gave his chin a stroke,And said “my friends I need a pack of smokes.”[Chorus]What a man he could’ve been.What a man he could’ve been.[Verse 3]So out the door into the frosty night,Eli went for his Camel Lights.I followed suit to take his keys,Saying “hey man, you’re way drunker than me.”He waved me off and said “I’m fine.”So we piled in and drove down the line.And for a Sunday night, things were looking up,Then I turned my head and saw the semi truck.
