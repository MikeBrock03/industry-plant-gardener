 Oh, no, you're not much moreThan putty at my fingertipsYou thought you knew this storyAnd suddenly it feels like no one ever liked youCold, cold like never beforeBiting at my fingernails, eyes glued to the floorIt's racing on your heels, this ain't a normal lunch dateThis meal is ending with your heartbreak Hey, I know I'm not a saintBut I'll do right tonightHashtag waste his timeBut I can't see you cryI'm begging for the strengthTo look you in the eyeHashtag waste his timeBut I can't stand, no Oh, I've been through this beforeDone things to guilt my sleep awayBroken oaths I'd swornAnd honestly it feels like hell with every heartbreakI'll heal and make another mistake
