(Verse 1)There's a time when your words are never more than constantAll the roads just pass you byThere's a path you can take, but your brain just blocks your visionAnd your words just slowly die(Pre-chorus)Can't somebody help me?I'm a blue whale stuck on a beach(Chorus)'Cause I'm bouncing off the ceilingAnd I can't remember rhymesAnd maybe I'll get out of bed this timeAnd I really wanna feel itAnd I really want a signPlease give me what I want and you'll be fineAnd you'll be fineAnd you'll be fine(Verse 2)There's a place you can go to remember all your victoriesReminisce what makes you grayWanna fall, wanna fly, just come give us a visitFor a trip down memory lane
