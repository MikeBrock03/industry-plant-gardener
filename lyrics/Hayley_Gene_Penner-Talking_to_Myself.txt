I'm talking to myself these daysMore than I usually do'Cause then I'll know how all would soundWhen they pour out in front of youWriting my words before I say themI wanna see them writtenSo that I'll be sure they look the way I mean them toAnd I might be crazyTo think that if it's perfect it will feel rightAnd I will feel fineAnd I might be crazyTo think that closure comes from saying goodbyeWhen sometimes it does but sometimes it doesn'tSometimes your words are perfectly spokenPerfectly clear, perfectly chosenWith perfect insightAnd it don't make it rightSometimes your heart's prefectly openYou think the truth will fix what's been brokenInstead it feels like you just can't make it rightCan't make it right, rightCan't make it right, right
