 I want to be goodI want to navigate this hate in my heartSomewhere betterI want to feel itBut with the feel, there is an ache I meetTo desire living Don't mind me whileI'm tackling this voidSlide tackling my mindThis weight feels likeI'm wrestling with my headObsessing in the dark So be good to me, be good to meYou and me always had a good timeAnd what else is left, babe?So be good to me, be good to meThe day's not a wash until you say Don't mind me whileI'm tackling this voidSlide tackling my mindLong nights where I'mI'm wrestling with my headObsessing in the dark
