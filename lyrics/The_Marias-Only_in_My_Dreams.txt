 Baby stay with meI feel it happeningI guaranteeWith every inch of meTonight I'll sleepWith demons in my hairThat talk to meIt's only just a dream Baby stay hereThe whispers in the treesAre getting nearYou're everything I needTo bare this fearThe demons in my bedThey're always hereIt's only just a dream Babe I'd rather stayInside your dreamIf I could disappearBeneath the leaves
