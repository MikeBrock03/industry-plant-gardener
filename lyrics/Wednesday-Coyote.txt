 You close the door in the hallIt makes the pictures fall from the wallWinter's singing in the showerAnd the leaves are changing color In my heart, you're number oneFell for you at the Texaco pumpI put mornings back togetherAfter tearing them apartI know it's time for bedYour eyes are getting redWhat's making the noise outsideWhen it's quiet on a Sunday night? Don't wash your hairThe socks and shoes and underwearThe attic light left on all nightMy back against your chair
