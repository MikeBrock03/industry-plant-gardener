I've got a bag of dutchAnd I'm not up to muchIf you want you could come and swing byStill get the hand on the clutch not quite a man of suchBut one day I'll take you for a driveI think I feel too muchI think I think too muchAnd darling that's no way to surviveBut I've got a bag of dutchAnd if you're not up to muchMaybe you could swing on byYou let me go right over my own headWithout you I know I'm better off deadAnd oh lord if you think I'll get in her head myselfOh darling I'm so fucking glad I brought the hand that I was dealtI bought a bag of dutch and if you're not up to much maybe you could swing on byCause I got this old tube going round to my doomAnd I wouldn't mind seeing those eyes
