 You know how it endedThrew your childhood blanket in a dumpsterYou, deserved it tooMe against the one you told me not to worry aboutI always knewAt least assumedBut now that someone's treating me betterWe're done foreverI'm still not rid of you 'Cause I never got my fillAnd I'm sure I never willIs that bad?Or does everybody love somebody still?Some days end before you're goodAnd you еnd up feeling ways you wish you didn'tThat shit killsOr does everybody lovе somebody still?Or does everybody? Lying by his sideKnow a part of me is wondering if his love is trueI love him tooBut I can't help but reminisceYou still exist somewhere out there, you doAnd the shit we've been through'Cause no one else has hurt meThe way you hurt meIn ways that good things never do
