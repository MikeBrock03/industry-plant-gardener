 I think we're getting kinda distantSo I try to cling onto youBut you had started resistingAnd your mind withdrewConversations inconsistentI don't know what to doSay it's not about commitmentYou're just so confused I need time to think about itI need time to think things through'Cause lately I've been drowningIn thoughts of youTell me, tell me how you're feelingSay it's all untrueGive me a reason for leaving'Cause I'm so confused These days it's hard to leave when I see you in every part of meYou're all I seeBoys will be boys, but you're not like the other onesWhat will I do without you when tomorrow comes?
