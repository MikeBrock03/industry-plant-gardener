It's flickering fasterThe hands spin 'round and 'roundImages rush by my window eyesThe dust in the light beamIt's glittering aboveEvery day makes me wanna fall in love(Its heavenly, euphoric, psychotic, hypnoticIt's electric, static, its glittering, in the nightIt's speeding up, the dust, in the light, has struckMe this time, it's just us, and our minds)The soft glowing moonlightIt pours in from aboveIt reminds me how to fall in loveYour life under laughterIt pass me from my mindAs we are closer to the window eyesDon't waste your lifeDon't waste your timeYoure blinded by designBlinded by designBlinded by designLook with your eyesOpen your mindIt doesn't always have to be this wayIt doesn't always have to be this wayIt doesn't have to end all of that muchYou could always clear the smoke and laugh it off as a jokeHa ha ha haHa ha ha haHa ha ha ha
