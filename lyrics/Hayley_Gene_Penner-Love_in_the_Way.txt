I'm so open for anythingLay down whatever you gotAnd I won't judge you for not being over the last thing you lostYou got all my attentionIt's all understandingWe'll handle you firstWhat's the worst that could happen?I'm all inI crawl inI'm fineFilling my timeFocused on mineUntil love goes and gets himThe way all that mattersIs tossed to the sideWithout realising with love in the wayLove in the wayI'm so comfortable constantly chasing someone aroundAnd I go further off out of my way if it's helping him outIt's like I've turned all my life into one long paradeInto falling for shadows and following shapesTo th–µ deep endI must love drowning
