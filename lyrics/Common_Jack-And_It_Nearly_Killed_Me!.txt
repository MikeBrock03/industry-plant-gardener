 Get me out of the desert sun,Give me a drink and we’ll have some fun,Cause it’s all a game.I’m not scared of a smoking gun,My skin is thick and my brain is numb,It’s all the sameI’ll go anywhere the moon has friends,I’ll follow him down where the black street ends,I’m not alone.I’m not scared of a spinning wheelWhere lives are lost and the dead can steal,I’ll throw the money stone. All I see:Lonely me. But I was thereIn the county chairAnd the judge’s hairWas white as snowBut he was gone,O my life!O my children!O my wife!Can you tell me, am I broken?
