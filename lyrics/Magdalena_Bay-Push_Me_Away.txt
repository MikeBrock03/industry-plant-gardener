 Right back to where we areFrom drifting far apartYou gave me half your heartIt's time now to restart Why would you do that to me?You're lacking serious empathyWhy would you push me away?All I wanted was for you to stayWhy would you push me away?Why would you push me away?Why would you push me away?Why would you push me away?Why would you push me away?Why would you push me away?Why would you push me away?Why would you push me away?Why would you push me away?Why would you push me away? You kick me downYou turned me all aroundI tumble and crashI'm warming up for round twoMy number oneYou were a loaded gunShooting through my head butWhen you wanna push, I pullWhen I'm empty then you're fullDid you mean to be so cruel?We're going further apartIt's time now to restart
