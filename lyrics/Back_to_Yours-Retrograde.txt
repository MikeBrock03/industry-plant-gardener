(Verse 1)Sweet melody, it comes to me when I'm sleepingGet me up, get me upAnxiety, it comes over when I'm speakingShut me up, shut me up(Chorus)Oh, I'm slipping down the rabbit holeGive me a toothbrush and a burner phoneAnd don't contact me 'cause I'll be gone for a whileMy mind is movin' retrogradeI can't come back now 'cause it's too lateAnd you won't see me at all today or tomorrow"Cause I'll be gone for a while(Verse 2)I walk alone with all my sour emotionsTurn mе off, shut me downThey want me to fall right into divisionBut I can't seem to find a placе to rest my head and still feel safe(Chorus)I'm slipping down the rabbit holeGive me a toothbrush and a burner phoneAnd don't contact me 'cause I'll be gone for a whileAnd my mind is movin' retrogradeI can't come back now 'cause it's too lateAnd you won't see me at all today or tomorrow"Cause I'll be gone for a while
