[Verse 1]Today things seem a little bit clearerI catch myself lookin‘ in the mirrorFinally I see her[Pre-Chorus]No I don‘t want to waste our timeBut baby I can‘t denyI‘m glad I got to take this rideWith you[Chorus]We can blame it on the timin‘, location, the fightin‘, the growin‘ upBut baby we‘d be lyin‘, we held each other downSo stand up, stand up, stand upWe could work it but we tried it, not worth it to fight it, this faded loveStuck inside a rhythm, just take a look aroundAnd stand up, stand up, stand up[Verse 2]One week and I feel so freeSpend a minute talkin‘ to youBut it feels like threeIt‘s four the best now we both agreeIt‘s alright, take five for some time to breathe
