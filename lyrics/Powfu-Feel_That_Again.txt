I need a person right now, andI'm all alone on my couch, andI'm really thinking how I could do things way betterI'm still me and I still made it through the weatherIf I were you and you were me would things be way more differentLife just feels the same and lately I just feel indifferentI just want to take it back when we were only kids, andSkip out of our class just to give you hugs and kissesBut things are different now and feelings aren't allowedIt's funny now I try to hide em' back then, I was proud of themI wanna feel that again, I want to feel thatI wanna feel that againI wanna feel that again, I wanna feel thatI wanna feel that, I wanna feel that againYeah, feels like I fell and I landed in the deep endGetting wasted every party on the weekendsI meet girls but they never what I look forOnly feel love when I read about it in the bookstoreAbout time that the tables start turningSame shit I been searching and searchingGetting sick of all this learningWhy can't my life be perfectI need someone new, someone hold my cold handsWanna get the feelings that I felt in the pastI knew life wasn't gonna be easyBut wasn't expecting it this fast yeah
