 Am I not good enough for you?Is there something wrong with me?You say, "Don't cry, you know you’re mine"Baby, don’t you lie to me Am I just not what you want?Am I just not what you need?Is there someone who has your heartThat keeps you gone away from me? Is she prettier than me?Is her skin softer than mine?Can she give you what I can't?The things I cry for every night? Is it something in how she movesWhen you're undressed inside her house?Does she smile the way I doWhen she has you in her mouth? Do you not love me like you didWhen you told me that it's fine?That I've been hurt, cause you've been too?And that kind of pain, you don't mind?
