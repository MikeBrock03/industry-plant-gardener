 The day has been so grayThere's thunder in my brainBut I'll be okayI'm turning off the rain See yourself in a million colors if you wanna tryYou can see what you wanna see, open up your eyesSee yourself in a million colors if you wanna tryYou can see what you wanna see, open up your eyes(Who wants the bass?) I'll go out and playWipe the tears awayYeah, I'll be okayI'm turning off the rain See yourself in a million colors if you wanna tryYou can see what you wanna see, open up your eyesSee yourself in a million colors if you wanna tryYou can see what you wanna see, open up your eyesSee yourself in a million colors if you wanna try (See yourself)You can see what you wanna see, open up your eyes (Oh, oh, oh, oh)See yourself in a million colors if you wanna try (See yourself)You can see what you wanna see, open up your eyes
