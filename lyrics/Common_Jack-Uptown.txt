 It’s getting late, maybe I should goGo  find my baby where the lights are lowI  told myself I wouldn’t drink to spite herBut here I am with another ShinerI’m uptown at a crowded barThinking  about the band and where they areThe  sleepless years we were running wildBleeding hearts and half-drunk smiles Does  it hurt when you hear my name?When you smile does it feel the same?Are you lonely or just alone?To tell the truth I don’t really know I  was almost gone, you grabbed me againAnd said it almost feels like it did back thenYou asked if things were turning roundI said not so much but I won’t get down Does it hurt when you hear my name?When you smile does it feel the same?Are you lonely or just alone?To tell the truth I don’t really know
