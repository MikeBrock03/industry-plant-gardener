[Verse 1]I got a friend who don’t know which side to sleep onBut every girl in town wants to help him decideThey both know he won’t stay the nightBut you gotta give him props for tryingBless his soul it don’t take a mileIn those loafers to see he’s just her chauffeur back homeA couple milligrams and a TV showThey go down better alone[Chorus]He goesWhy should I make up my mindJust to change it overnightWhat a magnificent way to waste my timeYou know I would rather live my lifeRife with riddlesLying in the middle of the Kinsey scalеThe world’s a buffet and I came to gеt my fill[Verse 2]I got a friend who hasn’t paid rent in agesIn the minds of every man this side of the tracksThey all know he’s a little greenThe weekend queen is new to the sceneSome say he’s a tourist, oh wellAll those purists can go to double hockey sticks untilThey wanna leave a happy man alone
