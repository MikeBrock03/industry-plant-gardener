 I think of you while you're at workOut in the fields, tearing up the earthBut I like you best when you're at homeGiving it to me so nice and fucking slow No one’s ever gonna love me, no not like you doEvery night I’m crying in my sleep 'cause I'm dreaming about youAnd I've tried so hard to quit you like I promised my mama I wouldBut it's no good, it's no good You walk a fine line between god and animalYou're just a feral dog I worship in bedroom ceremonialsCut me up and take me like the bread and blood at churchLove's never been more than pain, so baby, show me how bad you hurt No one's ever gonna love me, no, not like you doEvery night I'm crying in my sleep 'cause I'm still dreaming about youAnd I've tried so hard to quit you like I promised my mama I wouldBut it's no good, it's no good It's no good, it's no goodWe're no goodYou're no goodI'm no goodWe're no good
