 Yeah, last night, my dad freaked out againMy mom left home and ain't comin' backThis pain's too much, I'm too young for thisBreak ups suck ass(Break ups suck ass) But that was back when I was youngI can hear it till this dayBoth them screaming out their lungsWishing I knew what to sayWe think love is what we wantTill we come across the bumpsBoth expecting different thingsNo such thing is perfect Love gets hard to give but I'm not sick of itLife's too short to stay in pointless argumentsI am not the same, I'll keep you in my graspPlease don't be afraid 'cause soon this storm will pass'Cause soon this storm will pass(Storm will pass) Let me start from the top, my dad walked out on my momI grew up asking the question; "Does the pain ever stop?"Now that I'm older I see, I needed people to leaveSo I could learn from the distance, I could learn how to breathe
