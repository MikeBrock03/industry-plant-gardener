(Verse 1)The night is over now, a woman walks endlesslyNobody by her side in the midst of jealousyShe walks up to a glowing sign and finds exactly what she needsA feeling overtakes her and she falls down to her knees(Chorus)And she said hey Mr. Mino Man, you're always there for meI don't care what time it is, please just take me where I want to beYou show me love and now I'm asking for another pieceThey call you Mr. Mino Man, but you're never mеan to me(Verse 2)Stеp by step, she walks alone, only sees the dimming lightsShe gets back to an empty home, no one to hold her tightStaring at that silent phone, her love will come any dayBut she knows that Mr. Mino Man is just a call away(Chorus)And she said hey Mr. Mino Man, you're always there for meI don't care what time it is, please just take me where I want to beYou show me love and now I'm asking for another pieceThey call you Mr. Mino Man, but you're never mean to meAnd she said hey Mr. Mino Man, you're always there for meI don't care what time it is, please just take me where I want to beYou show me love and now I'm asking for another pieceThey call you Mr. Mino Man, but you're never mean to me
