Carry what you can and keep your compass roseCloser to your heart than a man who says he knows.Hold onto yourself in the light of a summer dawn.Remember I long for you every day that you are gone.See through the thickest fog and know your way is true,True as a morning dove sailing on a sea of blue.Keep a coat so warm for the winterâ€™s icy yawn.Remember I long for you every day that you are gone.I will longFor your touchEvery dayEvery day
