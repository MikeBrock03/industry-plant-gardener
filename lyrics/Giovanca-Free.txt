This was my last dayI"m walking out, getting ready for a brand new startLeft your puzzled face gazing at the kitchen table babyWhat did you expect, messing with my heart like thatOh now the weight is off, I can feel it in my strollLet my eyes go shopping, jaws are droppingAll because it shows that I"m alive againDo anything l likeWithout the clocking, midnight stalkingTime to say goodbyeI"m free, I"m free, because I"m free, becauseI"m free because I"m free, because I"m freeBecause I"m free now(x2)So this is the ﬁrst dayI'll tell the world that they"re dealing with a brand new meSo bring your boogie down dear, you're cramping my styleNo more getting it for free, all in tth name of loyaltyOh yes the weight fallsI can feel the walls come downNever came to kiss the sky, now I ﬁnally know howI just spread my arms and the world stops making soundWhen I close my eyes my feet no longer touch the groundI"m free, I"m free, because I"m free, becauseI"m free because I"m free, because I"m freeBecause I"m free now(x2)Once you ﬁgure it out, it"s quite easyIt"s freedom babyRepeat after me
