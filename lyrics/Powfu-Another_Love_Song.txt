  (Ouse)And I fell in loveWhen your touch was like my drugAnd I found the oneWhen you left it fucking hurtLeft a mark on my heartI made a song for youAbout my love scarsI hope you hear it tooAt least I made it farFor the stars I shootI don't have it allUntil I have youUntil I have you  (Ouse)Yeah I could shoot for the starsBut the longer I fallMaybe I'll get my wingsIf I stay up til dawnAnd I wish that everything would stopI would get you the moon if it got you to talk  (Ouse, Powfu)And when I see you with the other oneI still fear what you left now my love is goneAnd I woke up today feeling something elseOr maybe it's just all the drugs that helped. (Yeah, ayy)
