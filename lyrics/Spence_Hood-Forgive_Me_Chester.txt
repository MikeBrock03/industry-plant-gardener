[Verse 1]Comes a maiden, shoulders laiden with a wrong she cannot right“How in sweet Emmanuel's name am I supposed to sleep tonight?”So I told her “Weeping’s for the weary, and you don't seem the typeTo withhold my happy ending, gimme something better to write”[Chorus]Forgive me, Chester, yesterday's breadIs all I can afford todayBrother you hang tight, don’t let the melancholy biteAnd I'll chase the sinners away[Verse 2]Comes a man with scars bone-deep and a conscience far from cleanThough he wore them proud and spokе rather loudly of things I had never seenSee talеs like his make the world go ‘round, for not even I am immune To the pain of a life well-lived hiding under a Sunday tune[Chorus]Forgive me, Chester, yesterday's breadIs all I can afford todayBrother you hang tight, don't let the melancholy biteAnd I'll chase the sinners away[Bridge]Comes a boy with ribs the cage of a beast I cannot tameThough the lines on his face left no space for a stranger to write his nameSo days I sat with the boy, and not for lack of attemptDid my pen stay dry and his story remain exempt
