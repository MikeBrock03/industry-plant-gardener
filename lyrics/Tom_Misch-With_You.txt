With you I stand, but for how long?For how long?But for how long...With you my colors raged, but for how long?For how long?For how long...With you, I am harborWith you there was no distanceFor how long?But for how long...With you we drew no linesWith you there was no divideBut for how long?For how long? Cause I wouldn't watch you go and leave all that we knowBut love's so hard to hold...Cause I wouldn't watch you go and leave all that we knowBut love's so hard to hold...With you I rest, but for how long?For how long?For how long...With you I've loved, but how love goes?How love goes?How it goes...With you I built a towerWith you it stretched to the sunBut how it crumbles?How it's gone...With you my voice would carry and drift on through the airBut how it falters, when you're not there...
