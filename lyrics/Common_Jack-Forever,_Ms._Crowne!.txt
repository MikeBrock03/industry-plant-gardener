Verse:If I could be part of something greater,I would give myself away.Oh I would steal the sun from the equatorJust to be by your side again.Chorus:I am nothing without you.After all we have been through,You've turned me into somethingI never thought I’d be.Verse:See the smile you drew on my face?Don't you think I look so damn lovely?Yes I would wait forever & a dayIf it meant you'd love only me.Chorus:I am nothing without you.After all we have been through,It would be a shameTo see you walk away.Verse:Come my love, you’re like a wire,Unwind yourself in my arms tonight.Come and swallow some sweeter fire,We'll nurse our troubled once more.
