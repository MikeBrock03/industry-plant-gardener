 No one wants to listen to the kids these daysYeah, the fibs these days, yeahThey say that we're all the sameBut they're the ones to blameSpeaking of the young as if we killed someoneBut we don't need your gunsWe're all too busy on the runTryna be someone The kids are comingThe kids are gunningThe kids are runningThe kids are comingThe kids are comingThe kids are gunningThe kids are runningThe kids are coming for you No one seems to understand the kids these daysAnd why we live this wayWe got to clean up the mess you've madeStill you don't wanna changeYou create the law but can't control our thoughtsAnd no, we won't be boughtWe don't just protest for the funWe're here to get it done
