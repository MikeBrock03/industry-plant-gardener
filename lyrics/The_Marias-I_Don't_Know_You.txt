 There’s a weight in my bedWhere you laid and you said"I don’t know you""I don’t know you"If we tried to retraceWould it show on my face?And remind youI don’t mind you And babe, this isn't rightBut if you'd rather dry your eyesThen honestly I’m fineWith keeping my trust in youIt's time to walk in my shoes, it's trueI've tried, makin' it up to youBut if I did all that I had to doWould you be here in my room? There’s a weight in my bedWhere you laid and you said"I don’t know you""I don’t know you"If we tried to retraceWould it show on my face?And remind youI don’t mind you
