 Ever since the day you leftMy days feel coldIce is stuck inside my chestNever warm inside my homeEver since the day you leftMy days feel coldLooks like winter with my breathYou melt away the snow Remembering summer timesShowing up at your house (at your house)Remembering summer nightsWhen me and u would sneak outRemembering fast food datesShare our food and one straw (one straw)Thinking 'bout what you would sayI canâ€™t believe your gone Ever since the day you leftMy days feel coldIce is stuck inside my chestNever warm inside my homeEver since the day you leftMy days feel coldLooks like winter with my breathYou melt away the snow
