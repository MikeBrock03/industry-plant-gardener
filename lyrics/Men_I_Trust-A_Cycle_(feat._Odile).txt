Dreaming of enhanced feelingsWords with no loss of meaningKnown limits shall give awayFresh apples that won’t decayBreathing craft and willSun pursues eternal extolsRotating spheres, shifting polesDeposed kings and queensAgainst new competing machinesStanding marveled… in aweMassive tides carefully smooth domain(s)Nature reveals itself to mankind againCirrhosis removed from patient menWho dare… come back flesh and boneTo reclaim the world as their own
