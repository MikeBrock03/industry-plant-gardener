[Verse 1]Sit where you please, baby I'm coming downTake up the warm side of the room, for nowThis is where I sleep and this is what I amYou don't know anything about what I, I can do[Chorus]I hope you like a liar with her eyes closed shutI hope you like a lover with her hands drawn upI hope you like the taste of how it feels to be wrong'Cause you are and you don't know me at all[Verse 2]Walk on your wayAnd take all your second chances backLearn not to say and just to do, oh you do'Cause this world's aloneAnd we've closed the playground, please go homeGo on and watch your friends on the nightly news[Chorus]I hope you like a liar with her eyes closed shutI hope you like a lover with her hands drawn upI hope you like the taste of how it feels to be wrong'Cause you are and you don't know me at all(You don't know me at all)
