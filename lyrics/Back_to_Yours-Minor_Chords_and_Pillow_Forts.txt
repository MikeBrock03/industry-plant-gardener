Now I foundA place to hide awayJust for todayAnd if you need meI'll be sleepingSoftly as you goMinor chords and pillow fortsI miss those yellow wavesMinor chords and pillow fortsI wish that I could stayNow I foundSomeone who likes meBut she won't hold my handSchool is overAnd I told herThat we'd meet againMinor chords and pillow fortsI miss those yellow wavesMinor chords and pillow fortsI wish that I could stay
