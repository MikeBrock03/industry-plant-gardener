 Daddy, there's pain in your smileI've never seen you so darkYou'll never walk me down the aisleYou won't make it that farMama took the key and she ranThe baby's blood is on your handsWe both know it's what you deserve I tried to pull you outBut you built this bed to rotLook at all this hell you've causedAnd you'll blame yourself 'cause It's all your faultIt's all your faultIt's all your faultIt's all your fault
