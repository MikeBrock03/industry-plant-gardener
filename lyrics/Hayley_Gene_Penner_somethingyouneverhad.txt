I've been crying in airports and dying for you to come back
Sobbing on freeways at night like an insomniac
But somewhere on Sunset feeling you slip through my hands
I thought "You can't lose something you never had"
[Verse 2]
I'm counting the reasons that we ended up like we did
I guess some illusions are harder to see from within
I should've noticed I built us a castle of sand
'Cause I know you can't lose something you never had
[Chorus]
Some things are worth risking all your life for
Worth running out into traffic to stop someone turning a car around
And, oh, some things are worth running through the night for
Feeling like dying, like losing a kid, or something as shit as that
Not something you never had
[Verse 3]
I wake up thinking that you're gonna land at my door
Tell me you know how your mom felt, suddenly sure
Lie on my bed and convince me you want me back
And I'll say "You can't take back something you never had"
[Chorus]
Well some things are worth risking all your life for
Worth running into a burning house just to pull someone out of the door
And, oh, some things are worth running through the night for
Feeling like dying, like losing a kid, or something as shit as that
Not something you never had
You might also like[Verse 4]
Sometimes I wonder if I'd do it over again
Wake up in Madison, meeting your face like a friend
Maybe I'd tell you we should just skip to the end
'Cause I know you can't lose something that never began
No, you can't lose something you never hadEmbed
