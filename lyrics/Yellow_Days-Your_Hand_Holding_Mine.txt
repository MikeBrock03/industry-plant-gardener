 A bruised soul, purple and blueBut I think I've found something in youYou hold my hand so close between yoursAll of this time I always thought it would be your hand Holding mineOh, holding mineOh, holding mineOh, holding mineHolding mineAlways thought it would be your handHolding mine For these days I just count the hoursOh, shape shifting away in all of those scoursYou hold my hand so close between yoursAll of this time I always thought it would be your hand Holding mineOh, holding mineOh, holding mineOh, holding mineHolding mineAlways thought it would be your handHolding mine
