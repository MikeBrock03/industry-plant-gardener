Sarah runs to feel the burning in her lungsAnd clear her headDo you know what Sarah meantWhen she said, "You be my guest"?And keep the pace to save your faceYou'll never make the placeWhy do you even run the race?I can't be what you needI am stuck in a dreamI am stuck in a dreamDon't you knowShe's been here all along in a dream?She belongs in a dreamEvery day I'll make promises that plague Sarah's heartSo I can watch her fall apart'Cause I know when I break her downWe'll spit on all the happy clownsThat live around this sunny townShe loves me like a dog (Doo-doo)And when we mess around (Doo-doo)I'll let her know the truth I found (Doo-doo, doo-doo)In my own hopeless hate (Doo-doo)And every time I wake (Doo-doo)I second guess the game I played (Doo-doo)Did I make a mistake?
