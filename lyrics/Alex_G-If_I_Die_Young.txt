If I die young bury me in satinLay me down on a bed of rosesSink me in the river at dawnSend me away with the words of a love songOh oh oh ohLord make me a rainbowI'll shine down on my motherShe'll know I'm safe with youWhen she stands under my colors oh andLife ain't always what you think it ought to be noAin't even grey but she buries her babyThe sharp knife of a short life wellI've had just enough timeIf I die young bury me in satinLay me down on a bed of rosesSink me in the river at dawnSend me away with the words of a love songThe sharp knife of a short life wellI've had just enough timeAnd I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdomI'm as green as the ring on my little cold fingerI've never know the lovin' of a manBut it sure felt nice when he was holding my handThere's a boy here in sun says here, love me foreverWho would have thought forever could be severed by
