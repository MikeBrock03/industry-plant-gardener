 Your life is so familiar that it feels like most of mineThe heart that's kept so close to me gets closer all the timeThe habit of your laugh and the way it feels so nearHas shown me that I know your voice in every sound I hear Rooms would look much better if they had you standin' in themJealous of the rooms whose floors can feel your weight upon themIf I could find the words to say what your leaving puts me throughHow can you live if you can't love? How can you if you do? Called you on the road again to get back on my feetThe pain was kinda wonderful 'cause it was so completeI tеll you you can't need me more than I tend to need youHow can you livе if you can't love? How can you if you do?If I could find the word to say what your leaving put me throughHow can you live if you can't love? How can you if you do?
