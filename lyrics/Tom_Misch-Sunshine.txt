 Cause you know girlThat every little thing you doEven when i'm feeling blueOh, It makes me smile As we going through some stormy weatherBless the fact we still move togetherCause I know we'll find the light on the other side Cause we’ll be just fineIf we take our timeLet the sun shineCause we’ll be just fineCause we’ll be just fineIf we take our timeLet the sun shineCause we’ll be just fine Even when I’m going underwaterI can breathe just fineCause you got me in my prime girlAnd it feels so good
