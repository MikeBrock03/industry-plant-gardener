 I knew you from the first timeYou walked up with your head highSome beer froth on your top lipBut too thirsty to feel itSo boy, don't make me lieAnd dream up gentle goodbyesI grew up for the first timeWhen my eyes turned to the skylineI held the world on one hipI shot you down with one blink So boy, don’t make me lieWhen you're just wasting your timeNo, boy, don't make me lieYou know I’m done for the night And the girls, and the girls, though you don't want to believe itWe've had enough, we've had enoughAnd the girls, and the girls, though you don't want to believe itWe've had enough, we've had enoughAnd the girl with the world that's unraveled from her fingersShe’s had enough, she’s had enoughAnd the girl, and the girl who doesn't know what to believe inShe’s had enough, she's had enough
