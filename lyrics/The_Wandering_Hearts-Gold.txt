Shadow of a strangerWet cheeks on the trainBlurred face in the windowLike your story, gone and washed awayYou feel like you're brokenI know I was the sameWe build walls around usSo tall, let me help you find your way Scars are stories to be toldBy the way, by the way, all the broken piecesOf your heart are made to be filled with goldSo don't hide away, hide away, hide away There's a light in the nightAnd it's breaking up the skyDon't you cry when you hear the thunder callingThere's a light in your eyesWhile you're breaking up insideTill you see it I can be your hand to holdAnd what's broke we'll mend with goldIf the sky breaks above youThere's beauty up aheadSo just let me comfort youAnd not the voices in your head
