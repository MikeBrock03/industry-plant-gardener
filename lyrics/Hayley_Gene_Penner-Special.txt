I feel like I'm something when I watch you do, what you doLike my life has purpose when I'm next to you, next to you'Cause if you're special and I'm the one you chooseAnd if you're someone then I am someone tooI am someone, I am someone, I am someone tooHere behind the curtains while I wait for you, wait for youWatching all the people as they scream for you, scream for youBut when the lights go down and I'm the last one in the crowdThen you come find meThen I'm special 'cause I'm the one you chooseAnd you're someone so I am someone tooI am someone, I am someone, I am someone tooStanding in your shadow while you hold my hand, hold my handWatching people wondering just who I am, who I amIf you're special and I'm the one you chooseIf you're someone then I am someone tooI am someone, I am someone, I am someone tooYeah I am special too
