 Winter's here and the wind's so chillWish I could go back when the heat was stillStay inside of this pale white roomI feel trapped, my mind, the impending doomDavy's lost in the deep blue pastAll he wants to do is to breathe at lastNights creep down so he sleeps all dayBut the future just seems so far away Riding in the way downRiding all the way downRiding in the way down Jessie grabs, she can't keep her flowAll the words hang there but she doesn't knowIcy dreams of the things insideShe can't keep her peace when her lover's highSadie thinks if she had the timeShe could make it big living out her primeThe city once was a place to thriveNow the city's gone, but her mind's alive
