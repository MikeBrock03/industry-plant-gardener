 You’re so sweet to meWill you be sour later?Let’s climb in our treeLooking back, looking back I remember Stepping out on the moonBack home where we’re fromDigging your companyThese days have just begun Nowadays the waves ride high as we crash on the ocean floorDusting off the daisy chain you wore when life was new and strangeTaking us back for a change You’re so sweet to meBringing treats back from the food trailerI could leave you a keyKicking back, kicking back feeling lazy Tripping around the houseBeen away too longSpinning me all your loveThough I’m lost and gone
