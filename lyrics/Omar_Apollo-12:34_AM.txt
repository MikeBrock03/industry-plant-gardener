 It's somewhere lostForever moreMy demons come for meWhen they hear my voiceOoh youLa da da da daOoohAvoid some daySmoke with you the other dayWe can love (love) ohI really wanna talk to youI really wanna talk to youAvoid some daySmoke with you the other dayWe can love ohI really wanna talk to youI really wanna talk to you How can I talk to you?I caught your eye across the roomDo we even need the truth for nowHow can I talk to youOur loving we should resumeI'm floating off your perfume
