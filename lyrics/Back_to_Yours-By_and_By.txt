I can’t remember your faceI just remember tastes and feelingsAnd a couple words you saidWhen I began to cryIt’s like you stole a part of meBeen praying for you every nightTo try and just not feel so angryTo try and not feel so aloneI guess everyone has to sleep somewhereI guess everyone thought that hands in hairAnd messed up makeup was theOnly way we’d feel whole againBut it’s notI guess Everyone has to hurt someoneEveryone needs to lie, and burnTo sеarch and turn the sheetsUntilThey can get thе love they needRubbed up against me like I’m woodTo try and kindle up the spark we hadBut it ran out of oxygenWhen you got so damn closeI began to suffocateToo much weight stacked on my chestAll you wanted was s-All you ever wanted was love
