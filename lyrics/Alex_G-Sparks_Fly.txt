The way you move is like a full on rainstormAnd I'm a house of cardsYou're the kind of recklessThat should send me runnin'But I kinda know that I won't get farAnd you stood there in front of meJust close enough to touchClose enough to hope you couldn't seeWhat I was thinking ofDrop everything nowMeet me in the pouring rainKiss me on the sidewalkTake away the pain'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smileGet me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go downGive me something that'll haunt me when you're not around'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smileMy mind forgets to remind meYou're a bad ideaYou touch me once and it's really somethingYou find I'm even better than you imagined I would beI'm on my guard for the rest of the worldBut with you I know it's no goodAnd I could wait patiently but I really wish you would...
