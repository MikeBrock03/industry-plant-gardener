 Everyone knew the end of our storyBefore I even saw a flag(How sad is that)Out of the blue you quit writing poetryAnd telling me how your day wasI’ve waited so long to say thatI can’t save youFrom the way you stand thereWaiting for your plants to dieAnd you wonder why Aren’t you growing tired of scattering remainsAnd waiting to see if the weatherman’s gonna change his tieCuz green means summer, and fuchsia brings the rainThey sayWell do you recallThe color he wore on the dayThe day wе passed away 20 degrees and she’s rеfusing my sweaterSays she’s better off this way(Wh.. what does that mean?)Well there’s superstitious and then there’s youWith your fetishFor noticing the blemishesYour only defense isYour horoscope said to be a pessimistI can’t hate youBut the way you made meFeel like a losing betI can’t forgive just yet
