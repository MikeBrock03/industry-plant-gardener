[Verse 1]Felt like high time to leave this cityI was getting me downWatching my whole world fall awayAs I‘m leaving the groundWe mapped out all these plans that we‘ll never get toCounting all the years to follow through[Chorus]I‘ll miss you at my doorLike beforeShowing up out of the blueAnd now it‘s hard to sayIf moving awayWas the right thing to do[Verse 2]Last Saturday you said you were happyThat I‘m making a changeYou‘ll be one ride awayBut will it be the sameI‘m mapping out these plans that I‘ll never get to, noCounting all the years to follow through[Chorus]I‘ll miss you at my doorLikе beforeShowing up out of the bluеAnd now it‘s hard to sayIf moving awayWas the right thing to do
