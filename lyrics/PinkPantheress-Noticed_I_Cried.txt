 It was early last week, you said, "We didn't really have that much in common" (Common)But what did you really gain from it? (From it)We split in two, now you don't want meNow it's the start of JulyYou thought that you broke my heart and now every time that you see me you vanish (Vanish)'Cause you assumed you really mattered (Really mattered)But I was sound, I had it patternedNow you're a burden of mine D-d-d-did you notice I cried, but only just a little bit? (Yeah)Tell you I lied, then split down in the middle'Cause you're taking one side, not the side that I likeBecause you know I can't lie when you're in my mindY-y-you're too cruel to be kind and I know that from experienceI can hear your replies, but it's maybe that I'm hearin' thingsAnd I heard all your lines, there's no lines that I likeSo I'll take that as a sign, you're a burden of mine (Hey) MineBurden of mine, mineMine, of mineMine
