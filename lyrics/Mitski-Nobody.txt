 My God, I'm so lonely, so I open the windowTo hear sounds of people, to hear sounds of peopleVenus, planet of love, was destroyed by global warmingDid its people want too much too? Did its people want too much? And I don't want your pity, I just want somebody near meGuess I'm a coward, I just want to feel alrightAnd I know no one will save me, I just need someone to kissGive me one good honest kiss and I'll be alright Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobodyOoh, nobody, nobody, nobody I've been big and small and big and small and big and small againAnd still nobody wants me, still nobody wants me And I know no one will save me, I'm just asking for a kissGive me one good movie kiss and I'll be alright Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobodyOoh, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
