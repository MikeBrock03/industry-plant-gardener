[Intro: Tema]Yesterday the fall blew inRiding on a gust of windBringing in memoriesFreshmen in the coffee shopLonely while the couples talkThat kinda ruined fall for me[Pre-Chorus: Tema]But now I feel alrightThere's new light in my lifeI don't mind the windNow there's sunshine on my skinSo I let it in[Chorus: Tema]You bring color to my life, you doNow I love autumnThe way I love you[Verse: Tema, Jackson Lundy, All]Saturdays in Lincoln parkWrapped up in your favorite scarfOh, we fell like the leaves (yeah)Now you watch the BacheloretteKeep sugar in my cabinetAnd you do it all for me
