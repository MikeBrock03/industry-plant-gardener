 Yesterday the fall blew inRiding on a gust of windBringing in memoriesFreshmen in the coffee shopLonely while the couples talkThat kinda ruined fall for me But now I feel alrightThere's new light in my lifeI don't mind the windNow there's sunshine on my skinSo I let it in You bring color to my life, you doNow I love autumnThe way I love you Saturdays in Lincoln parkWrapped up in your favorite scarfOh, we fell like the leaves (yeah)Now you watch the BacheloretteKeep sugar in my cabinetAnd you do it all for me
