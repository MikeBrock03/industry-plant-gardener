 I don't know what to do without youI don't know where to put my handsI've been trying to lay my head downBut I'm writing this at 3 a.m I don't need the world to seeThat I've been the best I can be, butI don't think I could stand to beWhere you don't see me On sunny days, I go out walkingI end up on a tree-lined streetI look up at the gaps of sunlightI miss you more than anything I don't need the world to seeThat I've been the best I can be, butI don't think I could stand to beWhere you don't see me And autumn comes when you're not yet doneWith the summer passing by, butI don't think I could stand to beWhere you don't see me
