 Was it all a blur?Were you in a golden cage?Were you in a daze?Did you even hear them say? Ain't it strangeAfter everything changedIf you go back that placeI would still feel the sameI would still feel the sameI would still feel the sameI would still feel the sameI would still Go wait it outSomeplace you can't be foundWhen they take it allYou'll never know nowYou'll never know what I'm seeingYou'll never know what I'm dreamingYou'll never know nowYou'll never know what's showingNow I don't know where I'm goingYou'll never know now, you'll never know
