There is a place that has no nameSomewhere off the coast of MontpellierSomeday we’ll throw our phones like skipping stonesOff a pier that would’ve made Monet moanAnd we can build a house for twoPopsicle sticks and a little glueLong as it’s you, dear, I’m here to stayAnd if the taxman comes aroundTell him that we both went fishing downThere at the flea market for complimentsWe’ll be the best-dressed pests in all of FranceEating honey and mascarpone in the morningVisiting Nina Simone when it’s pouring rainWhat do you say?We’ll hide Florence in the floorboardsAnd pour Paris in our glassesGrow Tarragona on the terrace ‘till the air smells like molassesWe’ll rub shoulders with sculptorsAnd I’ll tend to your rashesOh, at last, this silly little world is oursAt last, this silly little world is ours
