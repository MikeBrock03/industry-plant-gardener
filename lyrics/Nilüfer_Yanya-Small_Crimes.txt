 I'm a petty thiefAnd what I find I keepI was supposed to set an exampleBut I am a vandalYeah, the paper's niceBut it's the rush I likeYou don't care about the moneyWhen you're an adrenaline junkie Words will chain meAfter they let me looseAnd realise that maybe there are Small crimes butSome things I just wouldn't doWhite lies burnSometimes I just can't keep to And if I gave it upWould I still be a thug?You don't choose to play the bad guyIt's in your bloodlineAnd I left my heartAt the scrap metal yardYou don't get to be humanWhen you're a hooligan
