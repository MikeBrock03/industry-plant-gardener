Verse:I wasn't tiredI'm never tiredYouth will not be wasted on this oneIn a dark roomAnother dark roomShe said hey you're gonna like thisIt's easy to like by candlelight if not under the sunWho's feeling young now?Verse:Dark room to doorwayDoorway to sidewalkYouth will not be wasted on this oneIn a thick fogAnother thick fogI said hey this isn't like meIt's a little like there could be something new under the sunWho's feeling young now?Chorus:They try to tell us and at times we try to listenBut we can't hear a thing when all we think about are all the things we think we might be missing'Cause if we think we are we areAnd if we don't we aren't worth the time it takes to think of making love with who we're kissingThey tried to tell us and at times we tried to listenNo!
