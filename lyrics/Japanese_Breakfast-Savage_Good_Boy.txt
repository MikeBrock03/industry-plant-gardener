 I want to be your manI want to be your s- I want to be your manI want to be your savage good boyI want to take care of you When everybody's goneWant you to be the one that I come home toThe one that's up waiting I want to make the money 'til there's no more to be madeAnd we will be so wealthy, I'm absolved from questioningThat all my bad behavior was just a necessary strainThey're the stakes in the race to win I've got a five year planI've got a pension and six condosA billion-dollar bunker for two And when the city's underwaterI will wine and dine you in the hollowsOn a surplus of freeze-dried food
