  You knowYou knowYou knowYou knowYou knowYou know  You think that you create the wavesBut I create youTwo-headed mother in your bedYou know she hates youKissing tyrannical heads spitting at youBabe, fire you wade throughThe ways I fuck myself and get down goodNever need to mind youI've loved before, I'll kill againYou're just the worst of all my menI'm not gon' pull you out the den so they don't bite youI won't feel good again until I'm up inside you
