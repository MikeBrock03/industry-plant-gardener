 I watched you move awayLittle dead i felt that dayYou were all in my mindI'm not trying to be unkind You disappeared at the shore lineBefore the touch of your hand wrapped in mine, wrapped in mine I scatter every piece of youI cross gray waters than youI felt your ghost leaving meI couldn't hold to your memory, memory Tenderly smile and wave goodbyeAs a small tear falls from your eyesThis love that was coming from me became harder to see As I let go all of all of youIt was lost to the days out the blue I scatter every piece of you (If you leave me, how you leave me?)I cross gray waters than you (If you leave me, how you leave me?)I felt your ghost leaving me (If you leave me, how you leave me? If you leave me, how you leave me?)I couldn't hold to your memory, memory (If you leave me, how you leave me? If you leave me, if you leave)
