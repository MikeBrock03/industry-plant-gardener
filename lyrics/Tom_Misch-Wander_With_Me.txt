 Wander with me, we can disappearHands still touchingSo you know I'm nearWander with me, streets will hold us downLeave it all now'Cause I need you around, around, around... And baby it's alright with meI can be all that you needBaby it's alright with meWander, wander, wanderAnd baby, it's alright with meI can be all that you needBaby, it's alright with meIt's alright, it's alright, it's alright Wander with me, need to call you homeYou felt nothingNow you never feel aloneWander with me, winter won't let goA dream of sunlightLining your shadow
