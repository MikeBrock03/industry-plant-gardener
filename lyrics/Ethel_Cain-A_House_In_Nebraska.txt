 Labored breaths and bed soresSing it to me all day longWhen the aching sound of silenceUsed to be our favorite songYou and me against the worldYou were my man and I your girlWe had nothing except each otherYou were my whole worldBut then the day cameAnd you were up and gone And I still call home that house in NebraskaWhere we found each other on a dirty mattress on the second floorWhere the world was emptySave you and IWhere you came and I laughed, and you left, and I criedWhere you told me even if we died tonight, that I'd die yours These dirt roads are emptyThe ones we paved ourselvesYour mama calls me sometimesTo see if I'm doing wellAnd I lie to herAnd say that I'm doing fineWhen really I'd kill myselfTo hold you one more timeAnd it hurts to miss youBut it's worse to knowThat I'm the reasonYou won't come home
