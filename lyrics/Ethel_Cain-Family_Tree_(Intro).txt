 These crosses all over my bodyRemind me of who I used to beAnd Christ forgive these bones I'm hidingFrom no one successfully Jesus can always reject his fatherBut he cannot escape his mother's bloodHe'll scream and try to wash it off of his fingersBut he'll never escape what he's made up of The fates already fucked me sidewaysSwinging by my neck from the family treeHe'll laugh and say, "You know I raised you bеtter than this"Then leavе me hanging so they all can laugh at me
