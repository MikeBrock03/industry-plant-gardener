It's a tired fascination with everything I'm notAnd wasting nights wonderingTrying to figure outOh maybe if I'm quietMaybe if I'm lightOh maybe I'll be somethingSomeone you would likeIf I'm smaller andIf I'm differentJust a little lessWould you love me?If I wasn't thisWith some bigger lipsAnd some smaller hipsWould you love me?It's an overdone obsessionWith chasing what I'm notAnd something I've been hidingSpace I'm taking upAnd slouching in my shouldersAnd curving in my backAfraid that all this space I'm inIs just too much to have
