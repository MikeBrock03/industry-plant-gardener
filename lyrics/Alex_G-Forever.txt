 Burns in the sunLives for no oneSalt on your tongueLights out, no funDrink to forgetDon't get upsetOpen your mouthYou look so Out of itPull it togetherWe could love youForever and everOut of itPull it togetherWe could love youForever and ever Made up a gameNo pain, no gainUntil you breakMake no mistake
