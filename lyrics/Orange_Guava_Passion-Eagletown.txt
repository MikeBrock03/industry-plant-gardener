 I’ve always loved songs about growing up Things look so different todayNow that I’m flyin awayWalk past the swimming pool regular crowdBig kids on high dives that look so small to me now I was just hanging from the monkey barsScooting around in my little toy carNow I’m grown up I drive a SubaruI’m shifting gears I know what I gotta do Spread my wings it’s time to leave the groundSunshine streets and skies past EagletownFlying oh so high, just don’t look downBittersweet goodbye to Eagletown Packed up and ready to goAnd now the memories flowThe parking lot where we raced on shopping cartsThe skating rink where my first love broke my heart
