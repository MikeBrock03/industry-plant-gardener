[Intro]I’ve always loved songs about growing up[Verse 1]Things look so different todayNow that I’m flyin awayWalk past the swimming pool regular crowdBig kids on high dives that look so small to me now[Pre-Chorus]I was just hanging from the monkey barsScooting around in my little toy carNow I’m grown up I drive a SubaruI’m shifting gears I know what I gotta do[Chorus]Spread my wings it’s time to leave the groundSunshine streets and skies past EagletownFlying oh so high, just don’t look downBittersweet goodbye to Eagletown[Verse 2]Packed up and ready to goAnd now the memories flowThe parking lot where we raced on shopping cartsThe skating rink where my first love broke my heart
