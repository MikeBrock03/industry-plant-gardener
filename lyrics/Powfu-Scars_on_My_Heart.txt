 Yeah, uhI'm sick of loving, every time it's just a misconceptionI find a girl and she lead me into a new dimensionThinkin' 'bout the future, counting out all of our blessingsThen I find out it's all fake, and she leave me guessingI guess I learned my lesson, I guess we're better endedI wish I never gave my heart out, dummy should've kept itJust like a piece of paper, she ripped my heart in halfI guess this kind of thing is something I won't ever haveBut it's fine, soon I'll just get used to itTo keep my mind off of love, I'll just do stupid shitI fell asleep, questioning, "Is anyone for me?"Laying on my back, using music as a remedyListening and writing all these sad songsI'm happy for a bit but doesn't last longI'm tryna find the joy in all this chaosKeep on praying for my future, hope it pays off Broke my heart, you tore it in two (You tore it in two, yeah)So, why am I (Why?) still thinking of you? (Why am I thinkin' of you? Why?) Yo, lately it's fuck emotions, grab the dope and then I roll itI've been tripping off the potent, honestly, I'm omnipotentUsed to think about our memories, I cleared them like my historyWrote this in a grave to set the scene 'cause love is dead to meOur love was one-sided, I know you ain't felt the sameI bet you relish the fact that I fuckin' felt this painYou gave me comfort, you were like my shelter from the rainGripping the razor blade, I swore I'd never love againI'll keep that promise, trust me I won't break itI ripped my heart out of my chest and chained it in the basementKnockin' bottles till I'm wasted, clear to see I'm changin'Rather stick to blazin', and the dreams that I been chasin'
