Driving to HawaiiSurfing down the streetDreaming of these placesI may never seeMaybe if we get thereThings will be much easierAnd life won't be nothing anymoreWell babe then we’re togetherWe’ve always such nice weatherGuess we don’t need these places anywayWe’ll strum out and be picking our guitarsWe’ll drink all day and sing under the starsHow magically simple our life could beDriving to TahitiLets take off your bikiniJump in something warmerAnd fall asleep togetherMaybe when it’s all doneWe can grow our hair longLife won't be nothing anymoreWell babe when we’re togetherWe’ve always such nice weatherGuess we don’t need these places anyway
