 In paradise, I'll pay the priceBut now you're here, the birds appearIt all dependsI'd be here every day if only it made senseWhat you getting at? You do this anyway In paradise, I'll pay the priceBut please don't leave this up to meIt all descendsI'd be here every day if only it made senseNot all the time, but every now and then I get that you're a mess, but I'm out my mindI know they come in twos, but most of the timeI do not see the point if it means to tryYou have to fake it If this is what it feels likeI'm not sure I feel itI could do without, I'll go without a celebrationThink it might take me a week to recover from this feelingWe're feeling through the darkness, there's a graduationWhere do the good things go?
