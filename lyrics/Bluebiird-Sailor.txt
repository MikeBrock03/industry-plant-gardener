 Someone's telling lies in the factoryI can hear them ticking down the lineFeels mean like gasolineKill the bad wolf and all his sheepBuild a rocket and see the sunLeave out your toys, let them know you’re goneShow your tongue through your broken teethNo rules in emergencies I fought and I lost, I trusted but you're goneDid you ever mean to be so mean?There's red running through your cheeksI fought and I lost, I trusted but you’re goneDid you ever mean to be so mean?These words bring me to my knees Someones' telling secrets and breaking glassGot myself a live wire here in the shower andDo I even wanna ask?Tilt one back, better talk real fastThrow out your anchor and watch it catchSalt screams, don't you know these things reveal themselves?Oh sailor, don't you know you roam alone?
