 Let's go back, let's go back to the startLet's begin at the end when you tore me apartYou didn't try, didn't try to make me cryBut I bawled like a baby when you said, "goodbye"When you said, "goodbye" And I've been replayin' the same song for six weeksTrying to figure out what you're feelingAnd I've been replayin' the same song for six weeksTrying to find a piece of your heartbeat Can we go back? Can we go back? Can we go back?Can we go back? Can we go back? Can we go back?Can we go back? Can we go back? Can we go back? Sittin' back, sittin' back, in the backseat of your carSo when we went around cornersI could lean a little closer into your shoulderI have a heart attackEvery time you get up, get up, get up, get up, oh'Cause you said you'd be back soonBut the other ones said that too
