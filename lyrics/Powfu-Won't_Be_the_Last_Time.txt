 I know I should goSomewhere far from hereI just need to showThat I'm worth the priceBut I don't know what to do with my lifeAll the things that keep me bleeding all night(We can fall in love again)If I die I know it won't be the lastAyy, ayy, the last time that I see the starsAyy, the last time that I see your eyesAyy, the last time that I feel alive Yeah we're all running out of timeLaugh at the days gone byMiss you at my sidePass by when the stars collideYeah we're all running out of timeLaugh at the days gone byMiss you at my sidePass by whеn the stars collideWe'll meet back at thе bus loop, where you would waitI would run up and I'd hug youTalk to me, I wanna know you againLife gets better when you're with a friend
