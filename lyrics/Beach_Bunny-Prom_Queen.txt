 Shut up, count your caloriesI never look good in mom jeansWish I was like youBlue-eyed blondie, perfect body Maybe I should try harderYou should lower your expectationsI'm no Quick-Curl BarbieI was never cut out for Prom Queen If I get more pretty, do you think he will like me? Dissect my insecuritiesI'm a defect surgical projectIt's getting hard to breatheThere's plastic wrap in my cheeks Maybe I should try harderYou should lower your beauty standardsI'm no Quick-Curl BarbieI was never cut out for Prom Queen
