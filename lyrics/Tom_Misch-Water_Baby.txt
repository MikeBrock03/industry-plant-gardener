 'Cause I was born a water babySwimming with these timesThe grooves that turn the grey to sunshine'Cause I will live through days that break meSwimming with these timesThe grooves that turn the grey to sunshine I'm still tryna write the story as I see itThe trouble is when I say it, they don't believe itThey reckon I only say it but I don't mean itI'm tryna tell 'em I'd only say it if I can feel it'Cause money's tight, maybe tighter than it was beforeI'm helping out on a mortgage I really can't affordFamily breaking north, I cover the trips abroadShakin', I'm making another loss on another tourBut what I done it for?To see my mother in the sun abroadI run into trouble, that was coming for herMy little brother got the hunger forAll the exact same painThat makes the rain in my stomach pourSo let me paint it broaderThis for any dude who's got a daughterLiving off lines that your papa taught herAin't got no time to be coming for youGo with the flow of this running water
