 I don't know, that's a really good questionBecause I've been driving myself insaneMaking a complete ass of myselfLiterally trying everything possible to try to save what we haveAnd you've been throwing yourself at JeremyThat's not fairIt's not fair?I see the way you look at himI know, because you used to look me that wayLeo, I-No, I think we just need to start being realisticThe fact is that I'm still just a strangerI'm not trying to hurt you Stuck inside space and timeFeels like I'm dead inside (Dead inside)Nobody even looks at meThey all just walk on by (Walks on by)Stuck inside space and timeAll that I got is you on mind (You on my mind)Tears filling up my eyesSorry I never apologized Rain falling, bringing back memoriesEveryday I would walk you homeHeld you close so your hands don't freezeSweet talking, we would share all our thoughtsThe first time that you met my MomKept telling you to just stay calmI miss your hands in my pocketsThose warm nights on your lawn, star watchingPlease come back to meI don't wanna do this anymoreI just wanna beLike we were before
