 I need, I need youI want, I want you Three days my eye's keep turning blueMy head, my mind, it turns for youElla, ella me dijoToma este vino y baila tambien baila tambienElla, ella me dijoTome este vinoBaila tanto, baila tambien I need, I need youI want, I want you Drank too muchI really hate myselfTwo cars race down the hillSwerve quick, loose steering wheelTurn it offMy shit don't work at allI'm coasting hope I fallBut please don't take away my soulSoulSoul
