 Oh my heart, it's a fish out of waterOh my heart, it's a fish on the rocksAnd it bakes in the bad sunOh my heart, it's a rock in the gutterOh my heart, it's a rock and great boulderAnd stuck in the gutter And I throw my heart back to the oceanBut it don't go far, it come back floatingAnd I watch it wash it up with the dead fishBut it ain't quite dead, it just is like this Oh my heart, it's a house in tornadoOh my heart, it's a house in the skyIn the eye of tornadoOh my heart, it's a roof in El NiñoOh my heart, it's a roof made of strawIn the jaw of El Niño And I pour my heart a new foundationBut it don't set hard, it just stays shakingAnd I scratch my name, I scratch my name inBut it don't set hard, it gets mixed back in
