 I gave too much of my heart tonightCan you come to where I'm stayingAnd make some extra love?That I can save 'til tomorrow's show 'Cause I need somebody to remember my nameAfter all that I can do for them is doneI need someone to remember me I need something bigger than the skyHold it in my arms and know it's mineJust how many stars will I need to hang around meTo finally call it heaven? I need somebody to remember my nameAfter all that I can do for them is doneI need someone to remember me I need something bigger than the skyHold it in my arms and know it's mineJust how many stars will I need to hang around meTo finally get somewhere I can be all doneSomewhere like heaven
