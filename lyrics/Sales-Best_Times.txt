 Shoutout to my momI hope I look as beautiful as my mom one day I know I can be right with thisPickin' off, outta be mindin' my shitOutta my mindIt's a lieI know I can be right with thisPickin' off, outta be mindin' my shitOutta my mind, (I'll be fine)It's a lie You know that I'm nervousI'm going through cursesReading through your cursiveThe moment I knew itIt could have been fluidYou know that I blew itAnd nowThe best things I made upI wanted to show it all, be it allNo wonder why
