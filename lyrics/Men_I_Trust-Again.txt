 A trail looks evenRising with easeAnd it's gradually stretchingIn fair daylight view As cool windsBare my vague thoughts,A quiet journeyI embrace again,Oh I embrace again Slowed my pace down(Somatic burden)I see a wide sphereA table I thought Things now look idleLeaving reservedSparsely awareOf this new lapse As cool windsBare my vague thoughts,A quiet journeyI embrace again,Oh I embrace again
