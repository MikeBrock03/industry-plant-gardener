I don't like youLike you like youThat is quite a lotCause you're impatientAnd I don't thinkThat our star signs alignYou call me a cancerBut you knowMy birthday's not in JulyEvery single timeI take a leap of faithI get bruises on my kneesAnd pimples on my faceAnd as the time fliesI stay standing hereWondering how I could have let you drag me 'round for yearsBut that's the last timeCause I'm never gonna go on this ride with youNever gonna get high with youAgainNo I don't wanna make upJust to break upAgain
