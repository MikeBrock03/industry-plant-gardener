 Honestly, could it be?We fought hard but nothing matteredMemories chasing meI got far, but thoughts run faster Oh, and if I turned back timeWe’d kiss and laugh until we criedI’d look at you and I’d know itIt feels so good, can’t control itOh, and if we had all nightWe’d cross our hearts until we diedI’d look at you and I’d know itIt feels so good, can’t control it These pieces in my brainReflections etched in blameOh no, it’s okayAll along we had good intentionsThese pieces in my brainReflections etched in blameWe're lost, not in vainAll along we had good intentions
