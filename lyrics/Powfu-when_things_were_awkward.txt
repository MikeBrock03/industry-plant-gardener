 I walked by a girl with the same perfumeAs the one you used to wearI can’t help but to think of youAnd now I see you everywhereAnd time won’t stop for usBut maybe we can go a bit longerWe can both start againLet's go back to when things were awkward I remember running with you skipping classesIf our parents found outThey would probably kick our assesMe and you were troubled kidsTrouble's what we looked forWe were similarThere was nothing we were good forTalks with youSitting in the harbourWalk on the docksTill the skies got darkerSmall blue wavesAnd your eyes dark greenWhen you said goodbyeYou would kiss my cheek
