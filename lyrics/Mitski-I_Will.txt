 I will take good care of you, I will take good care of youEverything you feel is good if you would only let youI will wash your hair at night and dry it off with careI will see your body bare and still I will live here So stay with me, hold my handThere's no need to be brave And all the quiet nights you bear, seal them up with careNo one needs to know they're there, for I will hold them for you 'Cause all I ever wanted is here, all I ever wantedAll I want is always you, it's always you And we're not out of the tunnelI bet you, though, there's an end Stay with me, hold my handThere's no need to be braveAnd while you sleep, I'll be scaredSo by the time you wake, I'll be brave
