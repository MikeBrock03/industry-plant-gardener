[Verse 1]Half-asleep, crying in that old bathroomThen I lean up against the mirror toSee the way I look when I feel like I'm dyingGuess I like the way I look when I've been crying[Chorus]And I'm fetishizing struggle in my headWhen I could fetishize more fun things insteadLike feet and hair, the taste of sunscreenRopes and teeth, the smell of gasolineAnd other things that hurt me less[Verse 2](Love is hard)In my hands, every single word you saidOn demand, I can feel like garbage (Love is hard)In remembering how bad I used to have itI can relive all my bottom-feeding baggage (Love is hard)[Chorus]And I'm fetishizing struggle in my headWhen I could fetishize more fun things insteadLike feet and hair, the taste of sunscreenRopes and teeth, the smell of gasolineAnd other things that hurt me less
