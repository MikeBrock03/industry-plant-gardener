 There's nobody better than youIt took me a while till I knewBut you knew from the start it was us, didn't you?It just took me a while till I knew Now I lay as I study a blank wallWould you spare me your voice if I call?'Cause you waited and watered my heart till it grewYou just grew a little smarter too So I don't blame you if you want toBury me in your memory, I'm not the girl I ought to be, butMaybe when you tell your friends, youCan tell them what you saw in me, and not how I turned out to be There's some kind of burning inside meIt's kept me from falling apartAnd I'm sure that you've seen what it's done to my heartBut it's kept me from falling apart Now here I lay, as I wonder about youWould you just tell me what I'm meant to do?'Cause I've waited and watered my heart till it grewYou can see how it's blossomed for you
