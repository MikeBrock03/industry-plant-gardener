 You've been such a jerkSince you left last weekYou're careful with your wordsBut I'm pulling teethYou said this wouldn't hurtGive me cavities And all of your apologiesAre only empty calories After all this timeI start asking why I'm stayingWere you ever mine?Are we something that's worth saving?Every conversation puts meBack on medicationSometimes, sorry's just another word you're sayin' Do I look like her?Does she talk like me?Been feeling insecureCodependency isHard to break when youNever make it easy
