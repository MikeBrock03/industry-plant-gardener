 I got lost about an hour agoI sailed past that fork in the roadAnd now here I standA stranger in a foreign landAn empty barn and a weather vaneA picket fence that's seen its dayOh, I sit to stay'Cause I don't got much to do today, hey I go down to the local storeI caught a glance from the local whoreThat she threw my wayAnd I still got nothing to do todayI carry on down the streetI'm looking for a place to eatBut my belly's so fullWith all these things I'm hoping for, for And I'm wishing my legs awayOh, I'm wishing my legs away, oh'Cause they're taking me to nowhere safeOh, they're taking me to nowhere safe, oh, nowhere safe
