 Swaying softly, streetlights glowing through my windowsTrying on each dress I bought for youDo I look prettyWhen I ask you to hit me?Hands like barbed wireWrapped around my throat, making me cry like I told you I wanted in the car, on the long drive homeBaby, we're alone now Sunday morning, everything hurts except for youExcept for youExcept for youExcept for you And I like thinking I’m no different from youDifferent from youDifferent from youWhen I go home at night I think about the ways that I can get outOf the hold you’ve got me inOf the hold you’ve got me in You’ve still got time, waiting on the other sideYou’ll still be alright, if you just make it to the other sideYou’ll still be alright, even after all this timeYou’ll still be alright, you’ll still be alright
