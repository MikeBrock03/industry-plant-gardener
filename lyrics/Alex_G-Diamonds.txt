Shine bright like a diamondShine bright like a diamondFind light in the beautiful seaI choose to be happyYou and I, you and IWe’re like diamonds in the skyYou’re a shooting star I seeA vision of ecstasyWhen you hold me, I’m aliveWe’re like diamonds in the skyI knew that we’d become one right awayOh, right awayAt first sight I felt the energy of sun raysI saw the life inside your eyesSo shine bright, tonight you and IWe’re beautiful like diamonds in the skyEye to eye, so aliveWe’re beautiful like diamonds in the skyShine bright like a diamondShine bright like a diamondShining bright like a diamondWe’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
