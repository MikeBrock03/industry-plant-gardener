 I don't know how it happenedWas it always this way and I just couldn't see it?Heart burning hot enough for the both of usI never realized how much you were holding backAll the times I felt so plugged inYou were tuning outA muted channel, a cold shell, a hologram, an abyss How can I fight a kingdom of your demons?A mist so palpableYou can't have it allHer and all the pleasureA woman can give Do you trust me?Can you feel it?Total controlCan't let goIt could be blissMachinist Can't speakYou wanted it allLet go a piece of your heartAll the pleasure it givesLeave me lost in the nightShadows go in and go byI just wanted it all
