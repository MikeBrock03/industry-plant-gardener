 I can't take the music, it's too loudMy God, all these bodies moving to the soundI feel all my senses melting downInsatiable chaos 'til I'm inside out There's nobody-body, in my body-bodyThere's nobody-body, anybody-bodyThere's nobody-body, in my body-bodyThere's nobody-body, anybody-body Watch me disappear into the crowdOcean divided is bending to the soundHedonistic forces bring me downInsatiable chaos 'til my soul flies out There's nobody-body, in my body-bodyThere's nobody-body, anybody-bodyThere's nobody-body, in my body-bodyThere's nobody-body, anybody-body
