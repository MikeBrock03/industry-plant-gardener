 Take me back right to the startBefore this ache, I feel apartCloser than the air I breatheNever thought I’d see you leave Somedays, you call me in loveAnd I can tell it's realSomedays, you take meTo places I could never feelOh, you're here nowBut life's taking you far awayOh, you're here nowOne last chance to hear me say Why won’t you just stayWhy won’t you just stay, with meWhy won’t you just stayWhy won’t you just stay, with me Take me back when we were youngBy my side under the sunUsed to be just you and meNever thought I’d see you leave
