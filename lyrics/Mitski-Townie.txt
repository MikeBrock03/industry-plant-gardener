 There's a party and we're all goingAnd we're all growing upSomebody's driving and he will be drinkingAnd no one's going back'Cause we've tried hungry and we've tried fullAnd nothing seems enoughSo tonight, tonight, the boys are gonna go for more, more, more And I want a love that falls as fast as a body from the balconyAnd I wanna kiss like my heart is hitting the groundI'm holding my breath with a baseball batThough I don't know what I'm waiting forI am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be Smell that, it's wet grass, and smoke in my hairI think I've had enoughBut he wants a finale and I came preparedAnd we're not going backAnd I've tried sharing and I've tried caringAnd I've tried putting outBut the boys, boys, boys keep coming on for more, more, moreAnd change, change, change is gonna come, but when, when, when?
