Verse 1The sun, the moon, the starsA life, a world apartIs waiting for me on the other side of todayThe leaves, they’ll start to changeWhile I remain the sameWill I start to fall like they do?Will there be me and you?Can you feel the breeze?Will money fall from trees?And can I find myself in time to figure outWhat’s wrong and right?ChorusCause baby I’m a mess of emotionsAll my heart’s reckless, been bruised and brokenHandle with care, say you’ll be there for meCause baby I believeYou’ve got your flawsAnd I’ve got mineBut nothing matters when our fingers intertwineStay a whileCause you’re just what I needSincerely, me
