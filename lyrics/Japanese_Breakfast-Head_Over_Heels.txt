I wanted to be with you aloneAnd talk about the weatherBut traditions I can trace against the child in your faceWon't escape my attentionYou keep your distance with a system of touchAnd gentle persuasionI'm lost in admiration, could I need you this much?Oh, you're wasting my timeYou're just wasting timeSomething happens and I'm head over heelsI never find out till I'm head over heelsSomething happens and I'm head over heelsAh, don't take my heart, don't break my heartDon't, don't throw it awayI made a fire and watching it burnI thought of your futureWith one foot in the past, now, just how long can this last?Have you no ambition?My mother and my brothers used to breathe in clean airAnd dreaming I'm a doctorIt's hard to be a man when there's a gun in your handOh, I feel soSomething happens and I'm head over heelsI never find out till I'm head over heelsSomething happens and I'm head over heelsAh, don't take my heart, don't break my heartDon't, don't throw it away
