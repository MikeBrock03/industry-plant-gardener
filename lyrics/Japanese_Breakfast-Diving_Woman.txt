 I wanna be a woman of regimenA bride in her home stateA diving woman of Jeju-do I want it allI want it allI want it allI want it allI want it The men have gone and left againAnd no one's shocked or blames themAnother day is shot, my friendI'm picking up the piecesThat's the third dead dog I've seen on this highwayThese treads are wearing thinWhen I get back there, babyGonna make it a home You'll have it allYou'll have it allWe'll have it allWe'll have it allI'll have it
