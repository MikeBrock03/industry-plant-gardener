Your hand fits in mineLike it was made just for meBut bear this in mindIt was meant to beAnd I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeksAnd it all makes sense to meI know you've never lovedThe crinkles by your eyesWhen you smileI've never lovedMy stomach or my thighsThe dimples in my back at the bottom of my spineBut you'll love them endlesslyI won't let these little things slip out of my mouthBut if I doIt's youOh, it's you they add up toI'm in love with youAnd all these little thingsYou can't go to bed without a cup of teaAnd maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleepAnd all those conversations are the secrets that I keepThough it makes no sense to me
