 Grew up under yellow light on the streetPutting too much faith in the make-believeAnd another high school football teamThe neighbor's brother came home in a boxBut he wanted to go, so maybe it was his faultAnother red heart taken by the American dream And I feel it thereIn the middle of the nightWhen the lights go outAnd I'm all alone again Say what you want, but say it like you mean itWith your fists for once, a long cold warWith your kids at the frontJust give it one more day, then you'rе done, doneI do what I want, crying in the blеachersAnd I said it was funI don't need anything from anyoneIt's just not my yearBut I'm all good out here Sunday morningHands over my knees in a room full of facesI'm sorry if I seemed off, but I was probably wasted (Probably wasted)And didn't feel so good (Didn't feel so good)A life full of whiskey but I always deliverJesus, if you're listening let me handle my liquorAnd Jesus, if You're thereWhy do I feel alone in this room with You?
