 Flying high like the birds and the bees, and we’llFill the sky with these songs in the trees, 'cause we’reBuzzing, buzzing, and we’re humming, hummingAnd we’re loving, loving all dayFlying high like the birds and the bees, and we’llFeel alive while we float with the breeze, 'cause we’reBuzzing, buzzing, and we’re humming, hummingAnd we’re loving, loving all day Feels good when I’m near youI got the whole world in our rearview, butWhen you’re here I can feel you, likeA summer day in JuneMigrate from the bad times nowLove crimes never held me downWeaving through all these grapevinesHow we gonna find our truth? This flight can take you higherRise above all your firesTake you to your desiresJust follow me
