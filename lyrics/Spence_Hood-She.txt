[Verse 1]She grew up in a cloud of dustMan they just couldn’t build ‘em big enoughSure was fun but didn’t do those lungs any favoursAnd she grew up on a Monday nightCouldn’t go to bed ‘till it tasted rightAnd the lord damn near gave up on trying to save her[Chorus]And if you leave this girl aloneShe just might make your house a homeWhen you ain’t lookingSweet sister what’s cooking?[Verse 2]She’s a nice tall glass of Tennessee rainPictures drawn on the windowpaneAnd you could fill up a room with the breath that she’s been savingAnd if someday her train arrives, it’ll kill me twiceBut there ain’t much lеft in this town when a girl quits praying[Chorus]And if you leave this girl alonеShe just might make your house a homeWhen you ain’t lookingSweet sister what’s cooking?
