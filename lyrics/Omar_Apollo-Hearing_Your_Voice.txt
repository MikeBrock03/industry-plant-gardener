 Met a shaman, he was crazyCalled me stupid, stole my moneyTold him 'bout what we been facingI've been jealous, often datingKnow you stole my fuckin' phone andProbably read something real crazyHeard you changed your name in loversWish that I could call you baby But that's not fairYou got everything I needUsed to call me constantlyYou cut your hairChange it all except for meDon't take back what's meant to be It don't make sense to meBut I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voiceIt don't make sense to meBut I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice Wish you lived a little closerClean your house, borrow some clothes andMaybe talk 'bout CaliforniaHeard it's not like IndianaI got time, what you expected?Sleepless nights, felt disconnectedSmoke a lot, your dad don't careHe's on the porch catching some air
