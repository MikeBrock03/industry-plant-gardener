V1Snow falls slow, paving the wayFrozen roads, tell me to stayThis sharpening cold cuts through, down to my bonesBraving the wind, ill walk through the stormCBack on the road, I pick up my feet and goFixed on a star, I go with the hills and rollThe bus man said I had to pay my tollIt’s a long way home, it’s a long way homeBut we must fight onV2Break down the walls, so I can seeThat there’s still life, ahead of meInherently I know, but my minds lost at seaI’ll find land and be set freeCBack on the road, I pick up my feet and goFixed on a star, I go with the hills and rollThe bus man said I had to pay my tollIt’s a long way home, it’s a long way home
