Went to the shadow of the sunI cried underneath the moonlightI felt all the pain that i caused youI slept on the couch at nightI didn't stay a while the next dayBecause I know i wasn't rightAll my friends are goneAll my friends are homeAnd i still dont careEveryone should cut their hairEveryone feels aloneAnd I'm still here at homeEverything's gonna be okay'Cause I saw you today
