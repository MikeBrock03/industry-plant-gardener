 The dog's confusedShe just paces around all dayShe's sniffing at your empty roomI'm trying to believeWhen I sleep, it's really youVisiting my dreamsLike they say that angels do I came here for the long haulNow I leave here as an empty fucking hole Oh, do you believe in heavenLike you believed in me?Oh, it could be such heavenIf you believed it was real Is there something you can do with yourself?As I sift through the debrisWhile I empty every shelfAnd flounder in the muck that I'll be drowning in so soonYou can't watch me from the banks thenTurn to say you're swimming too
