 I can't hear any words they sayI swear I must have lost the frameWell, my friends think my soul is dead (thanks man)But I'm just trapped in my own head And I cry, and you cryCause we don't lieThe way things changeAnd I hold it down but I ain't the sameYou keep goin', keep goin'You have to keep goin', you keep goin'Well you keep goin', you keep goin', yaYou keep goin', you have to keep goin' And you have to keep goin' There is nothing that I can doJust waiting for something newAnd the time is swell before you even knowIt's gone, ya, ya And I cry, and you cryCause we don't lieThe way things changeAnd I hold it down but I ain't the sameYou keep goin', keep goin'You have to keep goin', you keep goin'Well keep goin', you keep goin', yaYou keep goin', you have to keep goin'
