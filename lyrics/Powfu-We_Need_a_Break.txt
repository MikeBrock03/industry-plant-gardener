 I got something on my mind (my mind)And it's driving me insane (yes)I know it's nothing that you like (you like)And it's something I can't changeIt's something I can't changeI feel some wayI feel some wayI think we need a break You made me need a breakIt's kinda hard to sayBut I been hurting you so much and that can't be okayI'm going insane from my addictionI just need a changeFor all the times I made you cryThey should me lock up in chainsWhy do you even deal with meWhen I hurt your own feelingsCause I got a bald head, looking like a grown pigI think we need a small breakBaby, I am not leavingBut it's hard to date a angel when I'm feeling like the demonI'm sorry
