 Day by dayFeel it start to fadeLeft to waitAnd look the other wayCount the nightsPain on the open sideAll I have and all I wish to hold Hmmmm! Time will tellTell all that listen wellEar to the earthAnd crack the outer shellRed remainsLinked to that faithful nameShow me light and give me edgesLift me upTake this weary soul from meCan we reach that far?
