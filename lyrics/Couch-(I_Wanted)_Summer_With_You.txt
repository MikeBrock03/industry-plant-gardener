 Sunday evening with your mom's guitarYou pulled me closer, mmmYou don't even have to tryTo win me over, just pull me closer(vocalising)One more sleep 'til I'm home with youI'm crossing oceans, mmmBut you picked lilies while I was awayA new devotion, I lost your focus And, oooh, now it's starting to all sink inI'm thinking about what we could have been 'Cause I wanted summer with youTell me you wanted it too(Tell me you wanted it, tell me you wanted it too) Kissin' down all your curves and marksNo hesitation, mmm'Cause I got nervous with you in the dark (in the dark)A new sensation, did you lose your patience?
