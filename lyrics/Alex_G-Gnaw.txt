 Yeah, you were scarredAnd you were cryin' loud, right out in the schoolyardAnd, yeah, I felt goodEverything I knew was looking just as it shouldI saw the treeCarved in it "666" and he found meBut I am no foolI know every time I look in his eyes, he sees me too Dry your eyesI won't tell your motherShe won't ever discoverThe things you kept under the coversAnd please don't cryI am not your brotherI am not your loverAnd there is nothing wrong
