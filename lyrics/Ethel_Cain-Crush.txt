 His window’s already passedSo he’s shooting at the glassKeeping guns in his lockerAnd he denies itLike it’s actually importantBut he lied 'cause I sure did watch himShowing up wearing blackAnd he knows thatHis daddy’s on death rowBut he’ll say it with his chest, thoughHis friends move dopeHe hasn’t tried cokeBut he’s always had a problem saying noHis older brother bagged the valedictorianHis mother steady screaming he should be more like him Can you read my mind? I’ve been watching you(You know it, you know it, you know it, you know it’s true)Couldn’t fight to save your lifе but you look so coolCamo jacket robbing corner storesHard odds to bеat when you’re on all foursGood men die too so I’d rather be with you
