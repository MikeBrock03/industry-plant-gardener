We were searching for a cometJust a crumb this world I want itBeckons to come and if I had a little fragmentI could wish on stars less stagnant magicFrom the depths of this pawI rest to stretch this way from a farImagine this world a view from it allShe said boy you know it's all right hereSee my face you know why I wakenFree my brain you know I'm forsakenOh my whim, won't you fall once moreI want you on my mindI hear it nowOh dire rain these clouds can't wait to partI hear you now, my loveYour mind has never strayed too farI feel it nowThis dose of clay lay beside my armWe always wonder 'bout the starsI always wonder 'bout herI'll seize bits of you, I hope you find your headUnder beaming ruins time and time againI'll seize bits of you, I hope you find your headUnder beaming ruinsOoh oh oh oh
