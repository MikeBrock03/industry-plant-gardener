 When you're youngYeah, you're a loaded gunSo, don't worry honey, you'll go right backWhere you started from Benny saved, saved a spot for you'Cause he knows you're comin' back, honey'Cause you always come backAnd you can't talk to him like that'Cause he's gonna hurt you badHoney, I bet you my spot in hellI don't know where it is you goBut I know he's going through your heart, honeyAnd straight to the house of god I know you're still here and you wish you could feel itI see you on a big screen and you're lookin' sick to your stomach Look at youYou look so confusedAnd I remember when you complained about being alone(I could do anything to you)(I could do anything for you)
