I have these thoughts going on in my headMy hopes are placed in some future aheadMy finite means tune the world to its willMy higher verb is forever fulfilledIf I live oldTo see my grey daysMy heart will stay true - and forever youngThis minute of goldI won't let it dazeCatching the fleeing moment bid it remainIf I live oldTo see my grey daysMy heart will stay true - and forever youngThis minute of goldI won't let it dazeCatching the fleeing moment bid it remainI have these thoughts going on in my headMy hopes are placed in some future aheadMy finite means tune the world to its willMy higher verb is forever fulfilledI contemplate this immortal outcomeA timeless trace of future times to comeI know I'm more than the span my lifeI know I'm more than my own local strife
