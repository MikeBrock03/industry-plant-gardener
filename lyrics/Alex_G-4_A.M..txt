It's pouring rain at 4 a.mI feel so close to you right nowBut have you fallen for me yet?I'd let you go but I don't know howAnd I know it's just another nightBut I fell for you againAnd I remember whenYou didn't wanna waste a momentYou were captured in my armsAnd stolen by my eyesIt's still your heart that lifts meAnd your words that can kill meBut still I'd run for milesJust to be near youOh ohhh?Your presence lingers on my neckI can't let go of you right nowI'm kinda scared of what comes nextI might just die if you forgetAnd I know it's just another nightBut I fell for you againAnd I remember whenYou didn't wanna waste a momentYou were captured in my armsAnd stolen by my eyesIt's still your heart that lifts meAnd your words that can kill meBut still I'd run for milesYou cut me openAnd you fill me with this hopeWhen you know this whole thing's hopelessAnd I'm hopelessly hopingThat you will seeWhat lies inside of meIt's pouring rain at 4 a.mI feel so close to you right nowAnd I don't wanna waste this momentCaptured in your armsAnd stolen by your eyes eyesIt's still your heart that lifts meAnd your words that can kill meBut still I'd run for milesSo close so close nowDon't let go let go nowWon't you fall for me tonight?It's still your heart that lifts meAnd your words that can kill meBut still I'd run for milesJust to be near you
