 I wish you'd knownHow far I'd goI was lost in my mindLost in my mindI was lost in my mindI wish you'd seenWho I could have beenI was lost in my mindLost in my mindI was stuck in my mind When you go, you go, you goI'm a sunless skyWhen you go, you go, you goI'm a sunless skyWhen you go, you go, you goI'm a sunless sky I miss the wayWe laughed that dayWhen you were mineWhen you were mineStill stuck in my mind
