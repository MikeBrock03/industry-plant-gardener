At least try to make it goodWhen I love you, itâ€™s a curseI will be myself for youMy love is trueI love you when you wear my clothesWhen you wear those shoesThe ones I got for youThe love that you giveYeah, the love is really thereIn the moments that we shareLove is everywhereHold you every nightKissing your third eyeShow me that you carePast the test of time
