 Oh, this world is way too much for meTry to run but keep on stumblingTry to talk but keep on mumblingDo you ever feel that way? OhhYeah, I been feelin' lowOhhYeah, I been feelin' low Oh this world is way too cold for meAnd this coat won't fix this over freezeLord, I know I pray on broken kneesWill I ever be okay? OhhYeah, I been feelin' lowOhhYeah, I been feelin' low I'm findin' peace in a pocket full of memoriesFindin' love in a head full of melodiesWhy won't you listen when I say it's all that's left of me?My mama's recipes, my only remediesI can't fake what I'm dreaming ofSeems like hell's freezing over, loveThis feel fits me like a broken gloveCan't you hear me from up above?
