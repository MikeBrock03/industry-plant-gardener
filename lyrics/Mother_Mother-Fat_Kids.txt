 I was a fat kidHe was a fat kidShe was a fat kid tooWhen you are a fat kidYou will always bite offMore than you could ever chew We could never run fastWe were always picked lastStaring at our new gym shoesWhen you are a fat kidAll your friends are fat kidsSweatin' to the fat kid blues Cakes puddings and piesThese are the apples of our little eyesCookies and cream puffs with something insideSomething inside, oh, making us wide, oh Standing in the cornerStaring at the dance floorWatching all the thin kids grooveWhen you are a fat kidYou can never practiceAll your little fat kid moves
