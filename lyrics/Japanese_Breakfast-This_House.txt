 This house is full of womenPlaying guitar, cooking breakfastSharing trauma, doing dishesAnd where are you?What if one day I don't know you?What if one day you leave?And all confused desire and time zone changesChange what's left of you and me?  Maybe it's all the drinks you're buyingI was feeling like a kidSpying on the hidden porn store camerasWaiting on your graveyard shiftAnd now you're out in CaliforniaJust like you always said you'd beAnd did you ever even love her?Or was it rooted in companionship and timing?Well, I'm not the one I was thenMy life was folded up in halfI guess I owe it to the timing of companionsI survived the year at all, at all, at all
