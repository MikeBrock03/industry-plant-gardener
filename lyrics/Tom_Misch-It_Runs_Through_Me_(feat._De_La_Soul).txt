 1, 2, 3, 4 I love the way it flowsI love the way it growsThere’s something in this sound that takes me farIt’s like a special songCan move my mood alongBut I cannot say you’ll hear through my guitar She told me add a basslineAnd everything will be alrightShe told me that the groove is mineIt will take us through the nightAnd where I’ll goCan’t explain I’ll never knowBut it’s beautiful You can’t take this away from meThe way I hear the melodyThe waves bring clarityRunning through meYou can’t take this away from meThe way I hear the melodyThe waves bring clarityRunning through me
