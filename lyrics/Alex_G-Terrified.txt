You by the light is the greatest findIn a world full of wrong you're the thing that's rightFinally made it through the lonely to the other sideYou set it again, my heart's in motionEvery word feels like a shooting starI'm at the edge of my emotionsWatching the shadows burning in the darkAnd I'm in love and I'm terrifiedFor the first time and the last timeIn my only lifeAnd this could be good, it's already better than thatAnd nothing's worse than knowing you're holding backI could be all that you're needing if you let me tryYou set it again, my heart's in motionEvery word feels like a shooting starI'm at the edge of my emotionsWatching the shadows burning in the darkAnd I'm in love and I'm terrifiedFor the first time and the last timeIn my onlyI only said it 'cause I mean itI only mean it 'cause it's trueSo don't you doubt what I've been dreaming'Cause it fills me up and holds me closeWhenever I'm without you
