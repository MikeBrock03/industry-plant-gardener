 I've hit bottom rock, swear I'm telling the truthBut down here, I'm dark and confusedAlthough I cannot tell if I'm paranoidOr it's all in my head, it's all in my headNo signal out here, my thoughts are white noiseWhat he say right now, if he had a choiceAlthough I cannot tell and I'd die to knowWhat's going on in your head, on in your head I can think what I wantI can feel what I feelUntil you say it out loudHow will I know if it's real?And I can do what I likeI'll never know what it meansSome validation is all that I need When it hurts just to touch, but you can't dull the pain'Cause it's telling you things that make you sound insaneLike they're calling you up, but it's not on the phoneIt's all in your head, it's all in your headThe longer it takes, read too far into the signsBut that's what it says, it's just a matter of timeBefore we're out of this place where we're no longer trappedAnd it's not in my head, it's not my head
