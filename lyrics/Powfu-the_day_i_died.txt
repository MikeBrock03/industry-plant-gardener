 Yeah, I crashed my car, sorry that I can't be thereAll those pictures on your wall, will you keep there?Feels like yesterday when I dropped you off at homeBut the flowers by my grave are getting oldYeah, I crashed my car, sorry that I'm not breathingVoice shaking, asking God if you can see meThe pain will fade away, and you'll find another guySoon will come the day I don't cross your mind Paramedics at the scene screamin'Saying that they couldn't stop the bleedin'Took a lot of trauma to the headMoments later said that I was deadDark outside just like my windows tintedHit the wall, was numb within an instantIf I could've swerved it would be differentSorry that I couldn't go the distanceCan’t help but think of youAll alone in your room when you drinkin' tooPassed out in your bed, skipping work in the morningWeight on your shoulders is getting enormousAnd honestly, this was my faultI cannot be there to catch you whenever you fallI scream out to you when you callBut you'll never hear me, I'm sorry I ruined it all
