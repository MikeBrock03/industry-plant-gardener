 I want to stayBut I need to goI want to be the best for youBut I just donâ€™t know what to do'Cause baby, yes I've cried for youThe time we have spent togetherRiding through this English weatherAnd as the pressure buildsSo does the tension between you and meTime has gone so fastWatching the leaves fall from our tree Baby, I just want you to knowI still love youLove youLove youLove youLove youLove you And the grass is always greenerOn the other sideMaybe you should come and take a trip sometimeOh you seem keenerWhen they turn to nightBut you trippin  out your mindBaby, tell me it's a signAs the pressure buildsSo does the tension between you and meTime has gone so fastWatching the leaves fall from our tree
