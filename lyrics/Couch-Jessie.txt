[Verse 1]I found your photo, your birthday noteSweet sentiments from long agoWe'd lay in the grass and soak up the sunYou saw the world different from anyone[Pre-Chorus 1]Oh you taught me, back at sixteenNot afraid to tear up the scriptThen you turned your back and quit the showAnd I'll never never never know[Chorus]Jessie, where'd you go?Why'd you cut me out of your life?Tell me, let me know, yeahLet me know you're doing alrightDo you regret erasing all of us?Jessie, I'll nevеr know[Verse 2]I know your voicemail better than I know your voicеI get the message but I don't get the choiceI still feel it in my chest every time I hear your nameIf you cut it off clear would I still miss you the same?Left on my own, don't know where to place the blame
