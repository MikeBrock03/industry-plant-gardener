 We used to lie awake in the back ofYour car listenin' to the White StripesI used to make you laugh 'til itHurt your sides and we didn't know whyNow, look how nothing has changedOnly time, only money, and we're a little olderBut still we're lyin' awake in the backOf your car with my head on your shoulder 'Cause we know that don't mean nothing 'cause never is just aWord that people throw back at each other when nothing seems to workAnd I don't know where this is heading or how our story endsBut I know right now we'rе together and that's really all thеre is We used to lie awake in the back ofMy yard listenin' to the White StripesI used to trace the stars like theCurve of your mouth, oh, in the moonlightNow look how nothing has changedOnly time, only money, and we're a little woundedBut still we're lyin' awake in theBack of my yard like we're never movin'
