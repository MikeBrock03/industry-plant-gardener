 What'd she say about me?Hands in pockets, so deepWhen I walk I see you stare, white lockers dripping with despairPooling around my feetHold your breath and don't speakWitnesses and zombiesAnd the way they glare as empty as an answering machineNo one here to hear your dreams Nah, you don't bother meI'm like electricity They say I'm dancing with my demonsThis is the dawning of the seasonMelancholy girls and nonbelieversThis is the dawning of the season What you heard about me?I see fire when I sleepI can disappear like drops of water trembling in the heatNo, you wonâ€™t see me
