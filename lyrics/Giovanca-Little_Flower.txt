Like a little flowerReaching for the sunLike half an hourOn it's way to become oneLike the early morningShaking off the dawnYou're the beginning ofA very good songLike a made up mindWalking through a doorThe first stepsAlways striving to be moreLike dots on the horizonPulling towards the shoreLike here and now comesAbout from beforeJust wait and seeGood things are on the wayWait patientlyAnd they will come your wayJust wait and seeThey'll wear your nameAnd find you in a matter of timeLike a ray of lightBreaking trough the gloomLike early MayOn the way to become JuneLike the deepest oceansMoving with the moonJust like the wind foretellingWhat's coming soonAnd like a little flowerIs growing in the sun and half an hourTicks away and becomes oneYou're moving up and forwardsLife has just begunSo keep on goingKeep on going onNow grow, tick away and shake it offGrow, tick away and shake it offGrow tick away and shake it off
