 The evening hydroplanes, the streetlights, they start screamingThe air is thick enough to hold, your nose starts bleedingYou kindly, slowly walk around your empty houseThe smallest sight of you is shimmering on the ground NovemberOh, November The love and sadness on the corners of your smileThe night outside is restless waiting for the lightThe windows smirk at me, they're letting in the darkThere's nothing like the way you loiter in my heart November
