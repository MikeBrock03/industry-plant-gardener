 You like control, well, I do tooTake off my clothes and watch me moveYou can come closer, I'll let you hurt meHow you choose Help me with the zipper on my skirt, it's stuckAs you kneel, I'll be watching you fix meThis view of you, of the top of your head makes me forgive you But how long, how long can we play this way?I'm tired, I'm tired of not loving youMy heart, my heart wants to hold youBut I know, I know, I know the rules Blue light, dark room, the white of your teethAs you smile at my trembling shouldersBut your skin, did you notice your skin?It cries a soft weep like mine I'll sell, I'll sell my whole to youWhat's my, what's my, what's my price?How 'bout, how 'bout just a part of you?'Cause I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want
