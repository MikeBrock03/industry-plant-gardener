 How are you today?I saw your friend's band playA little show last nightIt's not my thing, they were alrightYou're in my dream last weekI'd like to hear what you thinkWe passed a house, driving fastThe sun was shining on the grassYou made me stop and leave the carYou pulled my sleeve but not too hardRemember when you took too much?I didn't mind being your crutch We loved you then, it's not the sameI don't like how things changeI don't like how things changeI don't like how things changeI don't like how things changeI don't like how things changeI don't like how things change
