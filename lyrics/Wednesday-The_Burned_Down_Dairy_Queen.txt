 The burned down Dairy Queen I was hiding in a room in my mindAnd I made me take a look at myselfCash for gold in a counterfeit hellIt's good to know you're always there to even me out It was a pitiful timeI sulked through the house, I dulled out my mindA car stuck in ice at a dead end at nightI never know exactly what to think of my life
