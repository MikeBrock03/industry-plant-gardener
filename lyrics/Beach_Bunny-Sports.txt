 If you feel lonelyI could be lonely with youTell me, babyWhy do you seem so blue? Why are we so complicated?Maybe love is overrated I'm tired of waitin'I was never good at sportsSave the games for the girls on the tennis courtSay you need meBut lately, you feel unsureCome on to me, come on to meI need more(Ooh, ooh, ooh) If you feel brokenPromise I won't break your heartIf you shatterI won't let you fall apart
