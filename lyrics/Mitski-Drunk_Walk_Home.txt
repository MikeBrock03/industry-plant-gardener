 I will retire to the Salton Sea at the age of 23For I'm starting to learn I may never be freeBut though I may never be freeFuck you and your moneyI'm tired of your money And I sit on the curb 'cause it's the prettiest nightWith no one else in sightYou know I wore this dress for youThese killer heels for youSee the dark, it movesWith every breath of the breeze
