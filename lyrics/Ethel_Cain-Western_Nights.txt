 He's never looked more beautifulOn his Harley in the parking lotBreaking in to the ATMsSleeping naked when it gets too hotI watched him show his love through shades of black and blueStarting fights at the bar across the street like you doThe neighbors beat on the walls while I'm face-first in the bedShow me how much I mean to you, while I'm lying in these sheets undressed I'd hold the gun if you asked me toBut if you love me like you say you doWould you ask me to Trouble's always gonna find you babyBut so will ICrying only because I'm happyHold me across every state lineI'm never gonna leave you babyEven if you lose what's left of your mind'Cause you know I'll be right there beside youRiding through all these western nights I haven't spoken to my daddy in a long, long timeI don't want him to worry, always wondering if I'm alrightBut the neighborhood keeps getting smallerAll starved out when the money's paper thinAll that's left are your walls and you'll die thereI should have known that there's no getting in
