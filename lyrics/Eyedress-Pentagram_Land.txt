I love youJust the way you areI love youYou shining starIt all makes senseHow it keeps at me  You soul sucking inside out of me  I ain't like these white boysStraight out the hood boysWorking on the weekendYou don't have to pretendI can't even relate to youI have seen some real shitAnd I just can't forget itI love youJust the way you areI love youYou shining starIt all makes senseHow it keeps at me  You soul sucking inside out of me
