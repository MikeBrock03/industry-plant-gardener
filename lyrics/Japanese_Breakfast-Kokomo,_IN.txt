 If I could throw my arms around youFor just another dayMaybe it'd feel like the first timeNow that you're awayI'll just spend my life not knowingHow it'd feel to These days, I can't shake the awful feelingI'm missing something I can't placeIs that you?Manifesting like the fear of an oven left onGod, I felt so much back thenI was soft as a dune If ever you come backWherever you find your way toAnd though it may not lastJust know that I'll be here longing I'll wait, passing time just popping wheeliesAnd kicking round this flyover stateWatching you show off to the world the parts I fell so hard forGod, I wish we could go back thereLeft alone in my roomI know they deserve you tooAnd maybe I'm not that worthy
