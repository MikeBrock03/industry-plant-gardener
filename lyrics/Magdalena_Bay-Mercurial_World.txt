 Hold me down to the EarthWhen the storm's right in front of usTell me we'll make it workYou're as sure as the stars on top of us 'Cause of the way that you areSteady and sound when I feel so crazyThe way that you areHow could I doubt the obvious? We're spinning around, so let it rain downLiving in a mercurial worldYou'll be around, always holding me downLiving in a mercurial world Kiss me right where it hurtsWash away all the falling dustWorried I'll make you worseBut you're teaching me how to trust in us ‘Cause it’s the way that we areSteady and strong when it's all so crazyThe way that we areSo how could I doubt the obvious?
