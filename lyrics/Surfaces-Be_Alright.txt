 We'll be alrightWe'll be alrightWe'll be alrightWe'll be alright Head stuck to my pillowSunshine sneaking up through the windowThree birds peeping in the weeping willowAnd no signalI got ripped jeans cause my hand me downs holyFlaked on by my fridge like tonyGuess I’ll be eating all the words you sayAnd you say everything is gonna be okay 'cause We'll be alrightWe'll be alrightWe'll be alrightWe'll be alright And now the breeze got us feeling goodCruising 'round the neighborhoodLiving like a child wouldAnd love you like my mama couldWindows down if I’m around surround the oxygen with soundYou could be my lucy let’s kick it like charlie brownWoah baby loosen up that load you’re afraid to lose controlYou should listen to your soul
