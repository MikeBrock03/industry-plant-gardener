 I live in a house with a tin roof andEvery time it rains, I can feel my brainIt's moving back and forthUpside down, east-westFeeling and remembering everything you do  I was up last night tossing and turningCouldn't get to sleep and I slept through the morningNeed to clear my head and get out of the cityAll alone in the jungle you'll find me Close your eyes and hear my secretDeep, deep loving, hear my secretHear my secret, hear my secret Sometimes I can hear the tremble below mePounding through the floor, my body so restlessIt lives in the basement below some boxesMakes me feel so strange and so thoughtlessSo, maybe someday this roof will cave inYou'll find me on the floor looking at the starsThese walls are made of brick, plated in goldBut I'm still here growing so old
