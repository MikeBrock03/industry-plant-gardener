 You're home, you're home, you're home to meSo leave me, leave me, leave me a mapI'm here at my cliff looking down I cannot bear you a sonBut I will tryFor if I am not yours, what am I?I daydream I'd give one a name of my ownFor I, even I, even I am on loan I have, I have, I watch a dream breakingBreaking, breaking, breaking meAway from my cliff, I am looking down from I cannot bear you a sonI have triedBut if I am not yours, what am I?I daydream I'd give him a name of my ownFor I, even mine, even mine is unknown So let me go towards the morning starWith hope it won't disappear
