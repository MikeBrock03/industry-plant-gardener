 Is my lifeNot all that I thought it would be?Is it simply ordinary?Oh, is it far from all my fantasies?I lie awake (Lie awake)I lie awake at night and brood (Poor you)About the things I never do (Oh no)And how I'm missing out on love and truth Oh, love and truthWhy are they so hard to achieve? (To achieve?)Oh, love and truthWell, they're such hot commoditiesBut come in such small quantitiesOh, love and truth where are you?Oh, where are you?  I dance (a-shoop shoop)I go out on the town and dance (a-shoop shoop)I go and try to find romance (smooch smooch)But all I come home is with empty handsOh, boo, hoo, hooOh, no, no, no, no, no, no, noOh, cha-chagrin (Chagrin)Oh, all I really want is love and truth
