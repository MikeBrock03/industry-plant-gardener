 Once there was a melodyThat came from the depths of meThat's how it starts...It came from another placeTrail I can never traceNo matter how hardAnd it's strange how the story's yours nowAs it leaves my voiceThere was not a choiceBut to release you... There was a timeOh, to release youWhen you were mineOh, to release youAnd now you're freeOh, to release you'Cause I released youOh, to release you(repeat) Once there was too much too sayThough I should've find a wayAnd that's how it startsSorrows and ecstasyGrow all these words to meNo matter how hardAnd it's strange howThe story's yours nowAs it leaves my voiceThere was not a choiceBut to release you
