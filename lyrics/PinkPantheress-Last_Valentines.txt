 I crashed my car right into a treeI'd risk my life for a chance you'd come back to me (Yah)You called 999, then left me to bleed (Left me to bleed)I know you'd never cause an accident for me I'll count the stars tonight So last Valentine's (Last Valentine's), you spent it away (Spent it away)To be with a girl you said you never saw that wayIt hurts now to smile, it hurts more to breatheIt makes me so angry, all I do is grit my teethI still let this man take over meBut I know that I'm not the one it should beI should really take some tim–µ insteadTo figure why this plays out again and again I'll count the stars tonight
