[Verse 1]What’s the point of it allThe masses cry out, we just piss in a stallAnd try and get cloutTo better ourselves while the clock's ticking downAnd when you get to the endYou don’t have a single friendAt allSo what’s the point of it allThe pain sinks in at the governor's ballAnd a lifetime of sinTo obtain some pleasureWhile they all grab your wristAnd I hope you're happyWith your never ending bucket list[Chorus]But life’s such a beautiful mistakeThe sorrows, the passions, and the heartacheWe give 'cause we know how to takeBut life’s such a beautiful mistakeThe sorrows, the passions, and the heartacheWe give 'cause we know how to take[Verse 2]So what’s the point of it allThe masses cry out the order's rather tallAnd we just live on a ballThat’s floating through spaceWhile we try and get a tasteCause when your meaning is upJust try and find somebody you love
