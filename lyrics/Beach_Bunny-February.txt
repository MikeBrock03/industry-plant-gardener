 Strawberry ice cream, a summer's dayYou melt away through the cracks in my fingersI know that sunburn goes awayThe broken words I last heard still linger Maybe by Monday, I'll be okayAny day's better than FebruarySometimes I wonder how life would beAny day's better than February But if you called and you asked me to stayWould you give me the world or walk out in a day?Because I'm so afraid that if I let you inWhen the going gets rough, will you leave me again?Like February Summer's gone, seasons changeHe's got a heart of construction paperAll of his problems buried awayInside the sleeve of a green windbreaker Maybe by Monday, I'll be okayAny day's better than FebruarySometimes I wonder how life would beAny day's better than February
