 I was waiting for a baggieA powder bunnyI have a buddy I grew up withHe hooked it up for meI'm helpin' it my own wayWhen I'm stuck in bedA little more than a memorySticks in my head I really like the game we playedYou left the CD hereA lot of positive messagesAnd something left unclear (Oh, I know, it's all in the Bible!)(You ever think about space? What is it?)(Is it really endless?)(I mean, if you had a spaceship, could you go flyin' and flyin' through space forever?)
