 Hello, it's nice to see you againDid you miss me?We're meant to be friendsBut it feels like a centuryIn my head If I say something that comes out all wrongPlease forgive meFor feeling this strongLike it feels just like angelsHmmm in my head But darling the truth isIn darkness I'm ruthlessI wanna scream your nameAgain and again Maybe IAm tempted by all that I seeYou're nothing like meI'm circling the roomIn gold and French perfume
