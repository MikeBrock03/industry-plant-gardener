 So tonight I'm sleeping under the starsCuz I feel itAnd you're climbing up with meYour absence used to rip me apartWhen I close my eyesYou're still climbing up with me Tonight, I'm sleeping under the starsCuz I feel itAnd you're climbing up with meYour absence used to rip me apartWhen I close my eyesYou're climbing up with meIn myMemory
