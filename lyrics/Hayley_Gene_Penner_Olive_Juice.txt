Every morning every night
How I wish you
Would wake up and see my sight
'Cause I'm back home in Canada
Thinking how you'd fit here
Singing with my father, playing his guitars and driving to the cottage
Holding on to August, saying you were ready and you didn't understand
And I miss you
Every Sunday afternoon
'Cause we used to take your truck to Malibu
And I'm missing you from Canada
Keeping up my silence
Thinking if I'm quiet, you might find your senses and fill in all the distances
Show up at my doorstep, interrupt our dinner and tell me you were wrong
And I'm not staying quiet to punish you
No, I just thought I might need less of you
And I miss you
Every time I hear your name
'Cause I'm used to how it looks and sounds and tastes
You might also likeAnd I'm siting here in Silver Lake, running through our memories
Driving to the desert, climbing sun kissed mountains
I know you're drinking whiskey and I know you must miss me
Turning into a memory right before your eyes
And I'm not staying quiet to punish you
I just thought I might need less of you
And I'm not staying quiet to punish you
No, I just thought I might need less of youEmbed
