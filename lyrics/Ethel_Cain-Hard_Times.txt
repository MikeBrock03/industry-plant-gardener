 Hide me thereUnder the leavesNine going on eighteenLay it on meTell me a storyAbout how it endsWhere you're still the good guyI'll make pretend'Cause I hate this storyWhere happiness endsAnd dies with you I thought good guys get to be happyI'm not happyI am poison in the water and unhappyLittle girl who needs her daddy real bad In the cornerOn my birthdayYou watched meDancing right there in the grassI was too youngTo noticеThat some types of love could bе badPraying I'd be like youDoing all of the things that you doAnd I still doAnd that scares me
