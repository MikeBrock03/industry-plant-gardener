 I can see your ghost now (Woah)You're in my headI know you're thereGo now, heyGet out of hereI wish you'd disappear I could be anything you wantedBut the only thing you asked for is to loveBut never got itBut it's honest I was onAnd the profit was to nothingNever fought it guess it's obviousYou never ever really fucking bought itI guess it's my fuckin' problemAnd now I'm back at the bottomWith my demonsI really wished I woulda fought em Uh, staring at a ghostFloating on the coastGuess I gotta take another dose, ayeHide away the painLet it in my veinsSoon I'm gonna lose control
