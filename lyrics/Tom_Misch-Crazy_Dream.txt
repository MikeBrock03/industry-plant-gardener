 Crazy dream (x8) And as I wake up from this crazy dreamI hope that things remain as they seemCause as I wake up from this crazy dreamFrom this dream I had a dream about you last nightAnd we were listening to PharcydeSomething to something started spinning in the past lifeSo I kept the singing to the bar side, we were on the last rideSaying it's the past but the present moving fast I ain't thinking bout the last timeIt's fine, but they were saying did you ask myBrothers if I'm ready for the last lineNever in the way you move withIt's bugging me outI kept squeak, left feet don't trouble me nowIt gets peaked if the D starts loving the soundBut we were running from the beast, start fucking aroundCos if I break the singular jack, cause a little bit of trouble fill a fifth of the yackIt's not that quick to react if I finish the pact we move forward now, I'm bringing it back And as I wake up from this crazy dreamI hope that things remain as they seemCause as I wake up from this crazy dreamFrom this dreamCrazy dream (x8)
